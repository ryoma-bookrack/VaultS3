# Changelog

All notable changes to VaultS3 are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
semantic-ish versioning via git tags (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

## [4.4.77] - 2026-09-30
### Fixed
- **Object tags sent on the `x-amz-tagging` header were stored without being
  URL-decoded** (issue #61, reported by
  [@ETCDema](https://github.com/ETCDema)). That header carries the tag set encoded
  as URL query parameters, so a value containing a space, `&`, `=` or any
  non-ASCII character arrives percent-encoded. The server stored it verbatim, so
  `Tag1=Tag%201%20value` came back from `GetObjectTagging` as
  `Tag%201%20value` instead of `Tag 1 value`. `PutObject` and the `REPLACE` form
  of `CopyObject` were both affected. The tag set posted as XML to
  `PutObjectTagging` was never affected.

  The wrong value was written into the object's metadata, so **tags stored before
  this release are not repaired by upgrading**. Re-apply the tags on affected
  objects, see `upstream-docs/UPGRADING.md`.

  Smaller gaps in the same header closed with it. A malformed percent-encoding is
  refused with `InvalidArgument` rather than stored half-decoded, more than 10 tags
  is refused with `BadRequest` as `PutObjectTagging` already did on the XML body,
  and a literal `;` is refused with `InvalidTag` since S3 does not permit it in a
  tag and it cannot be told apart from a pair separator. A repeated key now keeps
  the last occurrence, matching what the XML body has always done.

- **`CopyObject` ignored `x-amz-tagging-directive`, and replacing an object's
  metadata silently destroyed its tags.** The tag set is governed by its own
  directive, independently of `x-amz-metadata-directive`, and VaultS3 decided tags
  inside the metadata branch. That got it wrong both ways. A copy asking to replace
  the metadata and saying nothing about tags dropped the source's tags instead of
  keeping them, which is what `aws s3 cp --metadata-directive REPLACE` sends, so an
  ordinary copy quietly lost every tag on the object. And a tagging directive of
  `REPLACE` did nothing at all unless the metadata directive happened to say
  `REPLACE` too, so a copy asking only for new tags kept the old ones. All four
  combinations of the two directives now behave as S3 defines them, pinned by a test
  per combination.

- **A multipart upload dropped almost everything the request asked for.**
  `CompleteMultipartUpload` builds the object's metadata from the upload record,
  and that record only ever held the content type, so an object assembled from
  parts lost its tags, its user metadata (`x-amz-meta-*`), `Content-Encoding`,
  `Content-Disposition`, `Cache-Control`, `Content-Language` and
  `x-amz-website-redirect-location`. Seven of the eight fields a single-shot `PUT`
  keeps. aws-cli and the SDKs switch to multipart on their own above a few
  megabytes, so this hit ordinary uploads of large files with nothing opted into.
  All seven are now recorded when the upload is created and applied when it
  completes, and a test pins the multipart result to a single-shot `PUT` of the same
  headers so the two paths cannot drift apart again.

  An upload already in progress when you upgrade completes normally. Its record
  predates the change, so that object keeps the old behaviour and loses those
  fields, the same as it would have before.

## [4.4.76] - 2026-09-22
### Added
- **The dashboard now ships a Russian translation** (PR #60, contributed by
  [@sweet0dream](https://github.com/sweet0dream)). It covers all 548 strings, so
  nothing falls back to English, and it is picked up automatically for a browser
  set to Russian or selectable from the language menu in the top bar. Five
  languages ship now: English, German, French, Russian and Simplified Chinese.

## [4.4.75] - 2026-09-12
### Fixed
- **Per-bucket encryption was broken on a cluster: most reads answered 503 and
  one replica was written in the clear.** Both reproduce on 4.4.74 and both are
  fixed here. A bucket with `ServerSideEncryption` switched on is worth checking
  after upgrading, see `upstream-docs/UPGRADING.md`.

  An encrypted object stores the MD5 of its **ciphertext** as the ETag, while the
  read path hands back plaintext. The clustered read compares the two to catch a
  copy that has not replicated yet, so it condemned every encrypted object as
  corrupt, asked another holder, was refused there for the same reason, and
  answered `503 SlowDown`. That check knew about SSE-C, where the customer key
  makes it obvious, and never about server-side encryption. Measured on a real
  three-node cluster: 1 of 8 reads succeeded before, 8 of 8 after, and 60 of 60
  objects now read back byte-identical through every node.

  Separately, a node decides whether to encrypt an object from its own copy of
  the bucket's config, and enabling encryption writes the config and the key as
  two Raft entries. A node holding only the first could not tell that state apart
  from a bucket that had opted out, so it took the plaintext branch: the first
  object written to a new encrypted bucket kept one replica readable on disk,
  permanently, in a bucket whose whole purpose is that it is not. Enabling
  encryption now waits for the cluster to apply the change before reporting
  success, and a node that still cannot see the key refuses the write with a
  `503` instead of storing it in the clear, which the client's own retry then
  satisfies. 2 plaintext replicas per 8 buckets before, 0 in 192 copies across 12
  buckets after.

### Added
- **SSE-KMS objects were unreadable on a cluster, and a per-bucket server
  accepted `aws:kms` and then stored everything in the clear.** Both are fixed
  and both were present in 4.4.74.

  The server decided whether an object was encrypted by asking the per-bucket key
  manager, which exists whenever `encryption.key` is set. SSE-KMS requires that
  key even though it never uses it, so the answer for every KMS bucket was "not
  encrypted": the response header understated it, and the clustered read used the
  same answer to decide whether to compare content, so every SSE-KMS object on a
  cluster failed that comparison and returned 503. The question is now the
  server's encryption mode rather than the presence of a key manager. Measured on
  a three-node cluster: reads went from failing on the proxying node to 10 of 10
  byte-identical through every node.

  Separately, a server running per-bucket encryption accepted a bucket configured
  with `SSEAlgorithm: aws:kms`, reported it back as KMS encrypted, and encrypted
  nothing, because only a per-bucket AES256 key encrypts anything in that mode.
  Every object and every replica in such a bucket was written in the clear. That
  configuration is now refused with `InvalidArgument` rather than accepted and
  ignored. Buckets already in that state hold plaintext, see `upstream-docs/UPGRADING.md`.

  SSE-KMS also no longer demands a static `encryption.key` it never uses, so the
  documented KMS configuration starts as written instead of refusing until an
  operator invents a key. `upstream-docs/CONFIGURATION.md` now says plainly that the three
  encryption modes are server-wide and do not combine.

- **Replica repair: a cluster now restores a bucket's replica count after a node
  is lost for good.** Copies were placed when an object was written and nothing
  ever re-made them, so a node that died took its copies with it and every object
  that had one there stayed a copy short, silently and indefinitely. Rebalance did
  not close that gap because it answers a different question: it moves an object
  when the ring says another node owns it, and skips one whose owner never
  changed no matter how few copies survive. The recovery runbook in
  `upstream-docs/SCALING.md` claimed rebalance restored `replica_count` after a node
  replacement. It did not, and now something does.

  A background scan reads metadata rather than the local disk, because metadata
  still lists an object whose bytes this node has lost, which is the case worth
  repairing and the one a disk walk cannot see. Each object is handled by the node
  that owns it, so the work is not duplicated across the cluster. Erasure-coded
  buckets are left to the erasure healer, which rebuilds them from parity.

  An unreachable node is never counted as a node that lost its copy. Only a clean
  "not found" from a peer is treated as a missing copy: a timeout, a refused
  connection or an error is an answer the scan declines to draw a conclusion from,
  so a brief partition cannot start a cluster-wide copy storm at the worst
  possible moment. An object no node still holds is reported as unrecoverable and
  nothing is deleted, since metadata still describes it and removing it would turn
  a recoverable operator problem into real data loss.

  On by default whenever a bucket keeps more than one copy, every
  `cluster.repair.interval_secs` (600 by default, negative disables it), throttled
  by `repair.max_bandwidth_mbps`. Run a pass now with `vaults3-cli cluster repair`
  and see what the last one found with `vaults3-cli cluster repair --status`.
  Helm exposes `cluster.repairIntervalSecs`.

### Changed
- Documented the dashboard search syntax. The `type:`, `tag:` and `etag:` filters
  had never been written down anywhere, so `etag:` in particular was
  undiscoverable, and the difference between the whole-bucket Search page, which
  is capped by `memory.max_search_entries`, and the Files page filter, which
  walks the store and is always complete, was not explained. Also records the new
  folder filter in the dashboard feature list.

## [4.4.74] - 2026-09-11
### Fixed
- **Cold start no longer stalls for minutes on spinning disks.** Building the
  search index walks the objects bucket in key order, which on an HDD is one
  random read per B+tree leaf page. A reporter with 250,000 objects sat
  unhealthy for 5 minutes 26 seconds on every restart, because nothing listens
  until that finishes. Two changes: the metadata file is now read through
  sequentially once before the build, so the pages are already in the OS cache,
  and the build stops once it reaches `memory.max_search_entries` instead of
  indexing every object and evicting back down to the cap. On the reporter's
  hardware that is 5m26s down to 4.8s of prewarm plus 2.8s of build. Startup now
  logs both durations, and **warns when the index is truncated** rather than
  silently returning incomplete search results. Reported and fixed by
  [@zhyc9de](https://github.com/zhyc9de) in #57 and #59.
- **Plain search terms no longer match an object's ETag or date.** Any four hex
  digits appear in roughly one MD5 in 2,000, so searching for something like
  `4435` returned dozens of unrelated objects. The searched text is now the
  bucket, key, content type and tags. ETag lookup moves to an `etag:` prefix
  filter alongside `tag:` and `type:`, matching on a prefix so a few pasted
  characters are enough, and `tag:` keys are now case-insensitive like the rest
  of the query. A bare `type:` or `etag:` with no value is now treated as an
  empty query rather than matching everything.

### Added
- **Filter within the current folder on the Files page.** A filter box that
  searches the direct children of the prefix you are in, so in `a/` the term
  `aa` finds `a/aa-1` but not `a/bb-1/aa.pdf`. Backed by a new
  `GET /buckets/{name}/search` which walks the store with the listing cursor
  rather than the in-memory index, so results are complete regardless of
  `memory.max_search_entries`, and which is authorised as `s3:ListBucket` on the
  bucket. Contributed by [@zhyc9de](https://github.com/zhyc9de) in #59.

### Changed
- The dashboard `<select>` controls now share one chevron aligned to each
  control's own padding, replacing the native arrow that hugged the right edge.
  Applies to all seven selects across the top bar, IAM, audit, migration and
  bucket detail pages. Contributed by [@zhyc9de](https://github.com/zhyc9de)
  in #58.

### Security
- Updated the dashboard test runner `vitest` from 4.1.9 to 4.1.11 for
  GHSA-82fw-gwwq-j7x9 (CVE-2026-84373), clearing Dependabot alerts #24 and #25.
  Path traversal and arbitrary file read through the `@vitest/mocker` redirect
  mock, both rated moderate.
  `vitest` is a build-time dependency: it never reaches the shipped dashboard
  bundle or the server binary, which `npm audit --omit=dev` confirms at 0
  vulnerabilities both before and after.

## [4.4.73] - 2026-09-11
### Fixed
- **A range read of a compressed object no longer decompresses the whole thing,
  and concurrent readers of an object that must be expanded now share one copy.**
  A compressed object was a single zstd frame, which cannot be entered in the
  middle, so a 1 KiB range request decompressed the object and sliced it: twenty
  concurrent range reads were twenty full copies in memory. New objects are
  written in the zstd seekable format, independent 1 MiB frames aligned with the
  `VS3S` chunk plus a seek table, so a range read decompresses one frame. Existing
  single-frame zstd and gzip objects still read, and a range on them now positions
  the decoder by discarding to the offset rather than materialising the object.
  The formats that genuinely cannot be streamed, pre-4.4.53 whole-object GCM,
  `VS3X` and KMS-wrapped blobs, now share a single decryption between concurrent
  readers rather than each making its own. Measured on a 600 MiB object with 20
  concurrent range reads: about 21 GiB peak before, about 59 MB after.
  Contributed by [@zhyc9de](https://github.com/zhyc9de) in #55.
  - A plain zstd decoder still reads a seekable object from the front, since it
    skips the seek table as a skippable frame, so a server older than this
    release reads these objects correctly.
- **SSE-C objects are readable on a cluster again, and a read no longer expands
  the whole object.** An object encrypted with a customer-provided key was sealed
  as one AES-GCM message and decrypted after the cluster stale-copy check rather
  than before it. That check compares what the engine opened against `meta.Size`,
  which is the plaintext length, so it was comparing a ciphertext length with a
  plaintext one and concluding the node held a copy that had not caught up: every
  SSE-C read on a clustered node was routed to a peer and then refused with
  `503 SlowDown`, and the peers answered the same way. SSE-C was unreadable on a
  cluster from 4.4.70, where that check was introduced, through 4.4.72.
  Single-node servers were never affected, since they have no peer to fall back
  to. SSE-C objects now use the same chunked `VS3S` format as server-side
  encryption, so a range read decrypts a chunk instead of the object: 232 MB
  allocated for a 1 KiB range read of a 64 MiB object before, 2.1 MB after.
  Reported and fixed by [@zhyc9de](https://github.com/zhyc9de) in #56.
  - Objects written in the old whole-object SSE-C format still read, with no
    migration. **Objects written in the new format cannot be read by a server
    older than this release**, which returns `403`. See the upgrade notes.

## [4.4.72] - 2026-09-09
### Changed
- The external authorization guide now opens with a quick start: enable the hook,
  point it at an endpoint, set a shared token, and then the step everyone misses,
  create an access key for a **non-admin** user, because the admin identity is
  never sent to the webhook. It also states up front that "auth" here means
  authorization and not authentication, so a dashboard login never reaches the
  hook and an S3 client has no login step to intercept. The section previously
  led with reference material, which is accurate but is not what someone needs
  when nothing is arriving at their endpoint. Follows the walkthrough
  [@rscataran](https://github.com/rscataran) worked out and posted in #52, which
  was a better starting point than what was here before.

### Fixed
- **Objects in buckets that never opted into per-bucket encryption are no longer
  read whole into memory.** With `encryption.enabled` and `encryption.per_bucket`
  both on, every read that was not a `VS3S` stream was buffered entirely before
  the server worked out it was looking at plaintext that needed no work at all.
  A 1 KiB range read of a large object copied the whole object. Measured on a
  400 MiB object with 20 concurrent range reads: peak memory 3554 MiB with 18 of
  the 20 requests failing outright, against 37 MiB and no failures after.
  Reported and fixed by [@zhyc9de](https://github.com/zhyc9de) in #53 and #54.
- **Plaintext objects larger than 1 GiB are no longer served truncated.** The
  same read path passed the object through a reader capped at 1 GiB, so anything
  past that was handed to the client short, with a `200` and no error. A 1.1 GB
  object now returns every byte, and a blob genuinely too large for the
  whole-object formats is refused instead of quietly cut. Fixed in #54.
- **The `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` response header now reflects the
  bucket rather than the global flag.** In per-bucket mode it was set from
  `encryption.enabled` alone, so buckets that had never opted in, and whose
  objects were plaintext on disk, were reported to clients as encrypted at rest.
  A false claim of encryption is worse than no claim, because it is the answer a
  compliance check reads. Reported in #53.
- **A plaintext object in an opted-out bucket is readable again when
  `encryption.legacy_key` is configured.** A headerless blob is either a legacy
  global-key object or plaintext, and nothing on disk distinguishes them, so the
  server assumed legacy and failed authentication on everything else: the write
  returned `200` and the read returned `404 NoSuchKey`, telling a client that an
  object it had just stored did not exist. The legacy key is now tried and the
  bytes are passed through when it does not apply. The zero-byte case had already
  been special-cased for this reason. This is the rest of it.

## [4.4.71] - 2026-09-07
### Fixed
- The external authorization webhook now explains why it is not being called.
  The admin identity is deliberately never sent to it, and a login is
  authentication rather than an access decision, so pointing the hook at a
  request bin, signing in as admin and browsing sent it nothing at all: the
  server logged "external authorization enabled" and then behaved exactly as
  though it were not. It was documented in five places and still cost the first
  person who tried it an hour (#52), which means the documentation was in the
  wrong place. The server now says it once in the log the first time an admin
  request bypasses the hook, names the audience in the startup line
  (`evaluates="non-admin identities only"`), repeats it in `vaults3 diagnose`,
  and answers it up front in the access-control guide. No behaviour changed.

## [4.4.70] - 2026-09-06
### Fixed
- **A delete marker over an object that predated versioning is now reversible.**
  An object written before versioning was enabled on its bucket carries no
  version id, and the delete-marker path only demoted objects that had one. The
  marker therefore overwrote the latest pointer, which was the only record naming
  the object, so removing the marker could not bring it back and the bytes were
  left on disk with nothing referring to them. S3 calls such an object the "null"
  version, and it is now adopted as one before the marker goes over it. Reads of
  the null version fall back to the ordinary object path, where those bytes live,
  and deleting it explicitly now removes them instead of orphaning them.
- **Compression now actually compresses when encryption is on.** The compressor
  wrapped the encryptor, so it was handed ciphertext, which does not compress:
  a 216,000 byte repetitive payload occupied 216,056 bytes on disk, exactly 1.00x,
  while the CPU cost of attempting it was still paid. Compression now runs on
  plaintext, before encryption. The same payload now occupies 123 bytes. Objects
  written under the old layering are still read correctly, without any rewrite:
  the outer compression is unwrapped before the blob reaches the decryptor, and
  both layouts can coexist in one bucket indefinitely.
- **A cluster node no longer serves stale bytes under fresh metadata.** Metadata
  replicates through Raft synchronously while object data is copied
  asynchronously, so after an overwrite a node could hold the previous bytes and
  the new metadata at once. The read path only consulted a peer when opening the
  local file FAILED, so it answered with the old object under the new object's
  `ETag` and `Last-Modified`: a silent wrong answer rather than a miss. A node now
  checks what it holds against the metadata, by size and, for objects written in
  the last minute, by content, and routes the read to a holder that has the
  current bytes, or answers `503 SlowDown` if none can be reached yet. Measured on
  a real three-node cluster: 24 of 40 immediate cross-node reads returned stale
  bytes before the fix and 0 of 40 after, in both the changed-size and the
  same-size case, converging in a median of 2 ms. Single-node servers skip the
  check entirely, and single-node throughput is unchanged.

## [4.4.69] - 2026-09-06
### Added
- External authorization webhook (`external_auth` in the config file). VaultS3
  can now POST each access decision to an HTTP endpoint you run and act on the
  answer, so entitlements held in another system can gate access without being
  copied into IAM policies. Off by default. This closes the gap reported in #52,
  where the feature was documented from 2026-02-28 but had never been wired to
  anything: the type existed, nothing called it, and no config key could enable it.
  - Deny-only by default. IAM must allow and the webhook must allow, so the
    endpoint can narrow access but never widen it. `authoritative: true` opts in
    to letting the webhook grant. An explicit `Deny` in an IAM policy wins in
    both modes and is never sent to the endpoint.
  - Fail-closed by default. An endpoint that times out, refuses the connection,
    answers non-200, or returns an unparseable body denies. `fail_open: true`
    serves the request instead and logs every such allow at WARN.
  - Decisions are cached for `cache_ttl_secs` (default 10), keyed on every field
    sent to the webhook, so the network hop stays off the hot path. Failures are
    never cached. At the default the feature costs nothing measurable (1959 vs
    1913 req/s on 8 concurrent readers), while `cache_ttl_secs: 0` drops the same
    benchmark to 220 req/s, so throughput becomes whatever the endpoint can
    serve. The server warns at startup when caching is off.
  - All 192 gated S3 conformance tests pass with the webhook enabled, both with
    and without the decision cache.
  - The admin identity is never sent to the webhook, on either the S3 or the
    dashboard path, so a broken endpoint cannot lock the operator out.
  - Configurable via `VAULTS3_EXTERNAL_AUTH_URL` and
    `VAULTS3_EXTERNAL_AUTH_TOKEN`. Reported by `vaults3 diagnose` and shown in
    the dashboard Settings page. See upstream-docs/ACCESS-CONTROL.md.

### Fixed
- Corrected the documentation for three access-control features that were listed
  as shipped but were never wired into the server. LDAP authentication, STS
  AssumeRole and the external auth webhook exist as library code under
  `internal/iam` with no configuration surface and no caller, so they have never
  been reachable in any release. They are now listed as planned rather than
  done. Reported in #52.
- Removed `POST /api/v1/sts/assume-role` from the API reference. That route does
  not exist and returns 404. STS session tokens are unaffected and continue to
  work at `POST /api/v1/sts/session-token`.
- Removed the claim in `SECURITY.md` that the external auth webhook validates
  its URL against SSRF. No such validation exists, and both related entries have
  been dropped from the in-scope list so researchers are not pointed at code
  that cannot be reached.

## [4.4.68] - 2026-09-04
### Security
- Updated `github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go` from 1.10.0 to 1.13.0 for
  GHSA-6c5v-hqjr-5xxp. A malicious or compromised AMQP broker could send content
  body frames larger than the negotiated `frame_max`, which the client would
  allocate for and process, so a broker could drive a VaultS3 instance into
  unbounded memory use. Only reachable when AMQP event notifications are enabled
  and pointed at a broker you do not control.
- Updated `golang.org/x/crypto` from 0.53.0 to 0.56.0, clearing three
  `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` advisories (GO-2026-6355, GO-2026-6354,
  GO-2026-6303). VaultS3 uses this module only for `acme/autocert`, so none of
  the three were reachable from VaultS3 code, confirmed with `govulncheck`.
- Updated the dashboard build dependencies `browserslist` to 4.28.8 and
  `postcss-selector-parser` to 6.1.4 for GHSA-73wf-gq98-2v4g,
  GHSA-c83g-rgw3-j3cx and GHSA-w9m9-85wc-3x92. These are build-time only and are
  never part of the shipped bundle or the server binary.

## [4.4.67] - 2026-09-03
### Security
- **A public-read bucket policy scoped to one prefix published the whole bucket.**
  Anonymous access was evaluated per bucket, never per key: a policy granting
  `s3:GetObject` to `Principal: "*"` on `arn:aws:s3:::bucket/public/*` made every
  object in that bucket anonymously readable, including keys the operator
  believed were private.

  The cause was in the resource matcher. `bucketPatternFromARN` truncated the
  Resource ARN at the first `/` and threw the key away, so
  `arn:aws:s3:::bucket/public/*` and `arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*` were the same
  pattern by the time the policy was evaluated. The authenticated IAM path always
  matched the full object ARN, so only unauthenticated access was affected.

  The truncation cut both ways. An explicit `Deny` scoped to a narrow prefix was
  widened the same way, so a policy allowing `bucket/one/*` and `bucket/two/*`
  while denying `bucket/one/nested/*` denied **all three**, since Deny wins and
  every pattern collapsed to the bucket. Scoped Allow and Deny statements now
  both apply exactly where they are written.

  Anonymous reads are now decided per object, matching the caller's full
  `arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/<key>` against the statement's Resource with the same
  wildcard matcher the authenticated path uses. Two related hardening changes
  come with it: a statement with **no Resource at all** now grants nothing rather
  than matching everything, and a bare bucket ARN such as `arn:aws:s3:::bucket`
  no longer covers the objects inside it, which is how AWS evaluates it.

  Operators who had scoped a policy to a prefix were exposed without any signal
  that it was not being honoured. Enabling Public Access Block blocked the
  exposure but also disabled public reads entirely, so it was a workaround rather
  than a fix. Reported privately by Cheng Fu.

## [4.4.66] - 2026-08-26
### Fixed
- **An unauthenticated request could panic the S3 handler.** A bucket with no CORS
  configuration makes the metadata store return `(nil, nil)`, which is how it
  reports "not configured" rather than an error. Three call sites ranged straight
  over `cfg.Rules` and dereferenced that nil.

  The worst of them, `addCORSHeaders`, runs *before* authentication, so any
  anonymous request carrying an `Origin` header and any bucket-shaped path was
  enough. The panic recovery middleware caught it, so the server never fell over,
  but every such request cost a recovered panic and a stack trace in the log.

  Found on the production instance, where internet scanners probing
  `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` triggered it three times in a single day. The other two
  paths, the CORS preflight handler and `GET /{bucket}?cors`, panicked on the
  same nil for buckets that had simply never been given a CORS policy. All three
  are guarded now, `GET /{bucket}?cors` correctly answers
  `NoSuchCORSConfiguration`, and the store documents the nil contract so the next
  caller does not repeat it.

## [4.4.65] - 2026-08-26
### Security
- **Bumped `klauspost/compress` from 1.18.2 to 1.18.7**, closing an out-of-bounds
  read in its `s2` decompressor (GO-2026-5841, reported by Docker Scout as
  GHSA-259r-337f-4rfw). VaultS3 uses this module for zstd compression and never
  calls the affected `s2` code, so no released version was exploitable through
  it, and `govulncheck` reported zero reachable vulnerabilities before and after.
  The bump removes it from image scans regardless, since an unfixable finding in
  a scan report is noise that hides the next real one.

  Two findings remain in the image scan, both by design. `GO-2026-5932` flags
  `golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp` as unmaintained: it has no fixed version, and
  VaultS3 does not import it. `CVE-2025-60876` is in the base image's busybox
  `wget`, which the image no longer uses for anything: the container health check
  runs `vaults3 healthcheck` instead, so no shell or HTTP client is invoked.

### Changed
- **Rate limiting is now on by default**, at a ceiling far above real client
  traffic: 2000 requests per second per IP and per access key, with a 4000
  burst. An unauthenticated request is rate limited *before* it is
  authenticated, so on a server reachable from the internet the limiter is the
  only thing bounding what a flood costs. Scanners find a newly exposed
  endpoint within seconds of it going up.

  The ceiling was chosen by measurement rather than by feel. A saturating
  8-thread `boto3` client runs at roughly 1300 requests per second, comfortably
  inside the limit, while a 64-thread flood attempting 4455 requests per second
  is cut off. The previously shipped numbers, 100 per IP and 50 per key, would
  have throttled that same legitimate client to 48 requests per second, a 24x
  reduction, which is why they were never safe to enable by default.

  This matters most behind a proxy: the per-IP bucket keys on the connection's
  real address, not the forgeable `X-Forwarded-For`, so every client behind an
  nginx or Kubernetes ingress shares one bucket. A low ceiling would have
  throttled an entire deployment at once. Helm and the Kubernetes manifests,
  which already enabled rate limiting at 200 per second, move to the same
  numbers.

  Set `rate_limit.enabled: false` to turn it off. An explicit `false` in a
  config file still wins over the new default, and is covered by a test.

### Fixed
- **The S3 conformance workflow could not build the server.** It ran a bare
  `go build`, but the binary embeds the dashboard from `internal/dashboard/dist`,
  which only exists after the web build, so a clean checkout failed with
  `pattern all:dist: no matching files found`. It passed locally only because a
  previous build had left that directory behind.

  It now writes a stub there instead of building the real frontend: this job
  drives the S3 API and never opens the dashboard, so building React would add
  minutes per run to embed assets nothing requests. `ci.yml` still builds and
  tests the dashboard properly. The failure-log step is guarded too, so a build
  failure no longer produces a second, misleading error about a missing log.

## [4.4.64] - 2026-08-24
### Fixed
- **`ListObjectVersions` returned nothing for a bucket that never had versioning
  enabled.** S3 lists those objects with the version id `null`. VaultS3 read only
  the version index, and an object written while a bucket was unversioned has no
  entry there, so the call reported an empty bucket.

  Not a cosmetic gap: `ListObjectVersions` is how tools enumerate a bucket in
  order to empty it before deleting it. A caller saw nothing, deleted nothing,
  and then got `BucketNotEmpty` from `DeleteBucket`, with no way to make progress.

- **Deleting the `null` version of such an object orphaned its bytes.** The
  version-aware delete looks under `.vs/`, but an object stored before versioning
  keeps its bytes at the ordinary path, so the file survived while its metadata
  was removed. Nothing referenced it afterwards, and because `DeleteBucket` asks
  the storage engine rather than the index whether a bucket is empty, the bucket
  could never be deleted. Same class as issue #47.

- **A bucket name containing `..` escaped the data directory.** The filesystem
  engine checked that a resolved path stayed under `<data-dir>/<bucket>`, but that
  target contains the bucket name, so a bucket of `../evil` moved the goalpost
  along with the ball and the check passed. Containment is now measured against
  the data directory itself.

  Not reachable through the S3 API, which validates bucket names on
  `CreateBucket` and requires a bucket to exist for every object operation. It
  was reachable through migration: bucket names there come from a remote
  S3-compatible endpoint the user points at, and that path called the metadata
  store directly without validation, then discarded the error from
  `CreateBucketDir`. `DeleteBucketDir` was the sharper edge, since it is
  `os.RemoveAll`. Found by a new fuzz target.

### Security
- **The Go toolchain was pinned to a version with nine reachable standard-library
  vulnerabilities.** `go.mod` carried `toolchain go1.26.3`, and a toolchain
  directive is authoritative, so released binaries were built with it regardless
  of what the build environment had installed. Nine of the advisories were
  reachable from code paths VaultS3 actually calls, across `crypto/tls`,
  `crypto/x509`, `net/http`, `net/url`, `net/textproto` and `encoding/xml`. The
  pin is now `go1.26.7` and the count is zero.

  Dependency scanning could not have caught this: it is the compiler, not a
  dependency, so nothing in the manifest changes when it is wrong.

### Added
- **S3 conformance testing against `ceph/s3-tests`.** VaultS3 advertises 80+ S3
  operations and had no external check of that claim. Its own tests are written
  against its own reading of the specification, so they cannot catch a misreading.

  `scripts/s3-tests/` runs the upstream suite against a real server.
  `implemented_tests.txt` lists the tests VaultS3 is expected to pass and CI gates
  on exactly that list, so it is a regression gate from the first day rather than
  a wall of failures nobody reads. A weekly sweep runs everything and reports which
  additional tests now pass, so the list grows one promotion at a time.

  The baseline is 192 gated tests of 838 collected, and the gate runs in about 12
  seconds. The first run that got far enough to execute found the two bugs above.

- **Fuzz targets for path containment**, run by `go test -fuzz` with no new
  tooling. They assert that a bucket and key can never resolve outside the data
  directory, and they found the bucket-name escape above. 19 million executions
  across both targets found nothing further.

- **`vaults3 diagnose`**, which prints the version and which optional subsystems
  are enabled. It reads the config only, so it works when the server will not
  start, and it prints no secrets, so the output can be pasted into a public
  issue. Every difficult issue this year was slowed by not knowing this: #49 was
  only reproduced after enabling storage wrappers one at a time, because the
  reporter never mentioned encryption. The bug report template now asks for it
  instead of asking people to redact a config by hand.

  It also flags interactions that have already cost a round trip, such as
  compression being a no-op under encryption, and warns when `cluster.secret` is
  empty.

- **`govulncheck` runs on every push and pull request.** Go's own scanner, which
  analyses whether vulnerable code is actually reachable rather than only
  comparing manifest versions. It found the toolchain problem above on its first
  run.
- **`golangci-lint` runs in CI, reporting only for now.** The `lint` Makefile
  target already existed and nothing ran it, so CI checked only `go vet` and
  formatting. It currently reports 77 issues, 50 of them unchecked error
  returns, so it does not fail the build yet: failing on all of them at once
  would just mean the job gets ignored. The findings are in the log to be worked
  down, and it becomes blocking at zero. Unchecked errors are not cosmetic here,
  issue #50's data loss was a discarded error return that reported success.
- **A `vaults3 healthcheck` subcommand**, used by the container image instead of
  `wget --spider`. The server probes its own `/health`, reading the same config
  it serves from, so a changed port, a reverse-proxy base path or TLS are
  followed rather than assumed. It exits 0 when healthy, 1 when it is not, and 2
  on a usage error, so a broken `HEALTHCHECK` line cannot be mistaken for a
  failing service.

  This does not by itself remove busybox from the alpine image, which is where
  the known wget advisory lives. What it does is end the dependency on an
  external HTTP client for liveness, which is the prerequisite for shipping a
  distroless image that has no shell and no busybox at all.

### Changed
- **Documentation-only changes no longer run CI.** Nothing in the workflow reads
  a markdown file, yet a README edit ran the full build, test, vulncheck and lint,
  and then republished `eniz1806/vaults3:latest`, handing every `:latest` user a
  new image digest for a change to a sentence. Now that the docs live in `upstream-docs/`
  as separate files, doc-only commits are common rather than rare.

- **The server now warns when compression is enabled together with encryption at
  rest, instead of reporting "compression enabled" and quietly doing nothing.**
  Compression is wrapped first, which makes encryption the outer engine, so a
  write is encrypted and only then handed to the compressor. Ciphertext does not
  compress, measured at 1.00x on a highly repetitive payload, and the CPU is spent
  anyway. The docs said "pick one" but the running server said "compression
  enabled" and nothing else, so an operator had no way to learn it from the log.

  The warning names which layer is responsible and how much it affects, because
  per-bucket encryption is the one case that is not total: a bucket that never
  opted in is stored as plaintext and still compresses. Fixing the layering itself
  would change the on-disk format, so it stays a separate change.
- **The README was split into `upstream-docs/`.** It had grown to 2,019 lines and 121 KB,
  and 58% of that sat under one heading: `Quick Start` held 40 subsections
  covering FUSE mounts, S3 Select, tiering, backups and rate limiting, so a
  reader who clicked "Quick Start" landed in a manual rather than a quickstart.
  The README is now 279 lines and keeps what someone needs to decide: what this
  is, how it compares, a real quickstart, a feature summary, maturity per
  subsystem, and the project promises.

  Everything else moved into thirteen task-scoped guides under `upstream-docs/`, indexed
  by [upstream-docs/README.md](upstream-docs/README.md). No prose was dropped in the move. The docs
  stay in the repository rather than on a website, so they are versioned with the
  code, travel with a clone or a fork, and can be fixed by pull request.

## [4.4.63] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **A zero-byte object could not be read back under per-bucket encryption.** An
  empty object carries no header and no ciphertext, but the read path still sent
  it to the whole-object decrypt, which rejected it as "encrypted data too
  short". Every empty object in a bucket that had not opted in became unreadable
  as soon as a legacy key was configured. Empty objects are ordinary in S3, so
  this was a silent read failure rather than an edge case. Found while building
  the migration below.

### Added
- **`vaults3-cli storage reencrypt`, to migrate objects off the pre-4.4.53
  encryption format.** Objects written before 4.4.53 were sealed as a single
  AES-GCM message. Such an object cannot be streamed on read, and not for want of
  trying: the authentication tag covers the whole message and sits at the end, so
  releasing plaintext before verifying it would mean serving unauthenticated
  bytes. So every read of one costs its own size in latency and memory, and key
  rotation does not help because rotation mints a new key version without
  rewriting any bodies. There was no way off it.

  The command reports by default and only rewrites with `--apply`. It pages
  through each bucket rather than materialising its index, and migrates one
  object at a time on purpose, because reading a legacy object materialises it
  and fanning out would multiply exactly the memory this exists to stop paying.
  A bucket that never opted into encryption stores plaintext, which also has no
  streaming header, so those are identified and skipped rather than rewritten for
  nothing.

  Verified end to end in containers: two objects written by 4.4.52, then read by
  a current build. **MD5 identical before and after the migration**, on-disk
  headers changed from the legacy format to `VS3S`, first-byte latency on the
  64 MiB object fell from 13.2 ms to 1.7 ms, and a second run found nothing left
  to do. The underlying write is atomic, so an interrupted migration leaves the
  original object in place.

## [4.4.62] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **DeleteObjects now authorizes each entry instead of demanding `s3:*`.** The
  router decides before the request body is parsed, so a call that names its
  objects in the body could only be checked once, and the route fell through to
  requiring `s3:*`. That failed closed, but it also meant an identity holding
  `s3:DeleteObject` could not batch delete at all, which is not how S3 behaves.

  `BatchDelete` now authorizes every entry individually, using
  `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` for entries naming a version and `s3:DeleteObject`
  otherwise, so the batch route cannot be used to get around the per-object rule
  that protects versions. A denied entry comes back as a per-key `AccessDenied`
  in the response rather than failing the whole request, matching AWS. The route
  itself now requires `s3:DeleteObject` as a floor.

  The identity is carried to the handler on the request context, and the check
  fails closed if it is missing, so a wiring mistake denies rather than silently
  authorizing everything.

  Verified in containers against 4.4.61 with a policy that allows deletes and
  denies `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`: the released build refused **both** calls,
  this one allows the ordinary batch delete and still refuses the version delete,
  leaving both versions on disk.

## [4.4.61] - 2026-08-23
### Added
- **RPM, DEB and APK packages, an SPDX SBOM, and Sigstore build-provenance
  attestations on every release.** VaultS3 shipped only tarballs and a container
  image, which is how issue #51 arrived: the tarball carried no config and the
  server would not start without one. A package installs the binary, a config
  marked `noreplace` so an upgrade never overwrites operator edits, a hardened
  systemd unit, and an unprivileged `vaults3` account, and it leaves
  `/var/lib/vaults3` alone on both upgrade and removal, so taking the package off
  a machine never deletes the objects on it.

  Verified by installing each package in Debian 12, Rocky Linux 9 and Alpine 3:
  files land in the right places with the config at `root:vaults3 0640`, the
  service runs as its own user, generates and prints an admin secret once, and
  answers `/health` and `/dashboard/` with 200. An edited config survives a
  reinstall and stored objects survive `dpkg -r`.

  Every release now also carries an SPDX SBOM per platform, a Sigstore provenance
  bundle, and a `windows/arm64` build.

  The SBOM is generated from the **binary**, not from the archive or the
  repository. Syft reads Go build info out of the executable and lists the 45
  modules compiled into it; pointed at a `.deb` it reports two entries, the
  archive and itself, which looks like due diligence and answers nothing. The
  build fails rather than publish an SBOM with fewer than ten entries.

  The provenance bundle is attached as a release asset rather than left only in
  GitHub's attestation store, so an operator can verify a download offline or from
  a mirror instead of having to call GitHub:

  ```
  gh attestation verify vaults3_4.4.61_amd64.deb --repo Kodiqa-Solutions/VaultS3
  ```

## [4.4.60] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **The erasure write path no longer holds the object in memory** (issue #38, and
  the write half of the memory reports behind #50). The read path has streamed
  since 4.4.38, but a write still called `io.ReadAll` on the whole object and then
  split and encoded on top of that, so one PUT allocated roughly the object plus
  its parity and concurrent PUTs multiplied it. That is what made large uploads at
  concurrency an OOM risk rather than a slow path.

  A write now streams the plaintext straight into the data shards and generates
  each parity shard on demand from them, a stripe at a time. Two passes are
  needed because parity at a given offset depends on every data shard at that same
  offset, and in a sequential stream those bytes arrive far apart. The second pass
  is normally served from page cache.

  **The on-disk layout is unchanged**, so existing objects stay readable and the
  streaming reader, the degraded reader and the healer are untouched. A chunked
  upload, which arrives with no declared length, still takes the buffering path.

  Measured in containers against 4.4.59, 64 MiB objects at concurrency 16:

  | memory limit | 4.4.59 | with this change |
  |---|---|---|
  | 512 MiB | peak 387 MiB, **OOM killed** | peak 185 MiB, survived, 389 MiB/s |
  | 3 GiB | 58 MiB/s, 87 errors, **OOM killed** | **597 MiB/s**, no errors, 99 MiB |

  Throughput improves rather than regresses, because the old path spent its time
  under memory pressure. Allocation for a write is now flat: quadrupling the
  object size changed it by 0.2 percent, where the old path scaled with the object.

## [4.4.59] - 2026-08-23
### Security
- **An IAM policy written with a bare-string `Action` or `Resource` was silently
  ignored.** AWS accepts both `"Action": "s3:GetObject"` and
  `"Action": ["s3:GetObject"]`, and most AWS documentation examples use the bare
  string, so policies are routinely written that way. VaultS3 typed those fields
  as arrays only, so the bare-string form failed to parse, and the loader that
  reads a user's policies discarded anything it could not parse without logging
  it. Such a policy was accepted by the API, stored, listed back intact and shown
  attached to the user, while taking no part in any authorization decision. **A
  `Deny` written that way protected nothing**, so an operator who combined a broad
  allow with a narrow deny had only the allow. Both forms are now accepted, and a
  policy that still fails to parse is logged as an error instead of vanishing.
- **An identity with an unparseable policy is now refused rather than authorized
  from the policies that did parse.** The S3 path skipped a policy it could not
  read and evaluated the rest, so a `Deny` lost to a parse error silently widened
  access whenever another attached policy allowed the action. The console path
  already refused outright, and the two now agree: an unreadable policy is not an
  absent one. The reason is logged with the policy name, the user and the parse
  error, so a broken policy is visible rather than merely inert. Administrators
  are exempt, so a malformed policy cannot lock an operator out of their own
  deployment.
- **Operating on a specific object version now requires the version-scoped
  action.** `DELETE` and `GET` with a `?versionId` mapped to `s3:DeleteObject` and
  `s3:GetObject`, so the standard arrangement of allowing `s3:DeleteObject` while
  denying `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`, which lets people delete recoverably but never
  destroy a version permanently, authorized the destructive call anyway. They now
  map to `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` and `s3:GetObjectVersion`, as S3 defines them.

  **This can look like a regression after upgrading.** A policy that granted only
  `s3:DeleteObject` or `s3:GetObject` no longer covers version-scoped calls. Add
  `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` or `s3:GetObjectVersion` for identities that should
  have them. Administrators are unaffected, since they bypass policy evaluation.

  Verified in containers against the released build with the same policy set: a
  permanent version delete that 4.4.58 allowed, destroying a version, is now
  refused with 403 and the version survives, while an ordinary delete still works.

## [4.4.58] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- **A degraded erasure read no longer materialises the whole object before its
  first byte** (issue #38). The healthy read path has streamed its data shards
  since 4.4.38, but the moment one data shard was missing it fell back to reading
  every shard in full, decoding the entire object and only then emitting byte one.
  That put the whole object on the heap and made first-byte latency proportional
  to object size, which is the exact behaviour #38 reports. Recovery now runs one
  aligned stripe at a time, reading only as many shards as the code needs, so
  first-byte cost is constant: measured on a 64 MiB object with a data shard
  removed, storage reads before the first byte went from the whole object to a
  fixed 4 MiB, and the same figure holds for a 32 MiB object as for an 8 MiB one.
  End to end in containers, first-byte latency on that object fell from 17 to 23 ms
  down to 3 to 6 ms with full-read throughput unchanged. Bytes returned are
  identical: the same decoder recovers the same data, just in slices.
- **The Audit Trail's Source IP column was always empty.** The API emits
  `sourceIp` and the dashboard read `sourceIP`. JSON keys are case sensitive, so
  the value was undefined on every row and the column rendered a dash. Nothing
  errored and no test failed, so a security log quietly lost the one field that
  says where a denied request came from. The address itself was always recorded
  correctly, including behind a reverse proxy, where the forwarded client address
  is used rather than the proxy's own. Tests now pin both the JSON field name and
  the forwarded-address behaviour, since either could break the column again
  without anything else failing.

## [4.4.57] - 2026-08-23
### Read before upgrading

These apply if you are coming from a version earlier than 4.4.56. Nothing in
4.4.57 itself changes behaviour.

**A clustered node will not start without `cluster.secret`.** Inter-node
endpoints authenticate with it and now fail closed. Set the same value on every
node before you pull this image. Single-node deployments are unaffected, and the
Helm chart already sets it for you.

**Rotate your admin credentials if this installation ever ran with
`vaults3-secret-change-me`.** That secret is persisted, and persisted credentials
win over configuration, so upgrading does not replace it.

**Everyone is logged out once.** The console signing key is now random per
installation instead of derived from the admin secret.

### Added
- A `NOTICE` file and a `## License` section in the README and on Docker Hub,
  carrying the copyright statement. The repository shipped the full AGPL-3.0
  text but never asserted copyright anywhere, which is one of the licence's own
  conditions and the foundation the open-core split rests on.
- A sortable **User ID** column on the dashboard's Access Keys page, so a key can
  be attributed to the application it was issued for. The user is required when a
  key is created and has always been stored, but it was never displayed, so the
  page showed rows of opaque hex with no way to tell which key belonged to which
  app, and no safe way to decide which one was safe to revoke. The built-in admin
  entry is labelled instead, since it is not tied to a created IAM user.
- A summary of the external security assessment in `SECURITY.md`, and a pointer to
  it from the README's production-readiness section. The findings were already
  itemised in the 4.4.56 entry below, but nothing told a reader arriving at the
  repo that the review happened, what it covered, or that two of the fixes need an
  operator action beyond upgrading.

## [4.4.56] - 2026-08-22
### Security

An external white-box assessment of VaultS3 reported 14 findings. All of them are
addressed here. Several were remotely exploitable against a default deployment,
so **upgrade, and read the operator actions at the end of this section.**

- **The console signing key is no longer derived from the admin secret.** It was
  `HMAC-SHA256("vaults3-jwt-signing-key", adminSecret)`, which made the key a
  function of a credential: anyone who knew the admin secret could mint a
  `sub=admin` session offline, without ever calling the login endpoint, and reach
  every admin route. While the shipped default secret was public that was true of
  every default installation. The key is now 32 random bytes per installation,
  generated on first start and persisted, and changing the admin password rotates
  it, which invalidates existing sessions as a password change should.
- **The console API now enforces per-bucket authorization.** It authorized on
  "is this JWT valid" plus a short admin allowlist, and nothing else, so any
  authenticated subject could list, download, upload, overwrite and delete
  objects in any bucket and change bucket configuration. The S3 API enforced IAM
  policies on exactly the same data, so a user refused a read over S3 could take
  the object through the dashboard. Every console route that names a bucket now
  resolves the caller to an IAM identity and evaluates the equivalent S3 action
  through the same evaluator the S3 path uses, and the bucket list shows only
  what the caller may open. With `oidc.auto_create_users` on, this was reachable
  by anyone with an account at the configured identity provider.
- **Inter-node endpoints fail closed.** `/cluster/*` and `/_replication/sync`
  authorized only when a cluster secret was configured, and the shipped
  configuration set none, so on a default clustered deployment they served
  anonymous callers on the public S3 port: cluster topology, an object-existence
  oracle, arbitrary object deletion, destructive reclaim, the full replication
  change log, and a rogue node joining the Raft quorum, which was demonstrated to
  take the cluster offline. An unset secret is now a refusal, and
  **`cluster.secret` is required: a clustered server refuses to start without
  one.** The same fail-open had been copied into the metadata shard RPC added in
  4.4.54 and is fixed there too.
- **Maintenance and cross-bucket routes are admin-only.** `/versions/rollback`,
  `/versions/tags`, `/reclaim`, `/heal`, `/speedtest`, `/migrate*`, `/search` and
  `/versions` were reachable by any authenticated subject. Rollback silently
  rewrote live object content to an arbitrary earlier version, reclaim deletes
  data files, and search and versions answered across every bucket.
- **The migration client no longer makes arbitrary server-side requests.** It
  fetched from any endpoint a caller supplied, so it could be pointed at
  loopback, the internal network, or the cloud metadata service at
  169.254.169.254, and the response was reflected in the error message. Those
  destinations are now blocked at dial time, so a hostname cannot resolve to
  something harmless during validation and to loopback a moment later, and
  connection errors are logged rather than returned. Operators migrating from a
  source on their own network opt back in per migration job.
- **A copy now authorizes its source.** `CopyObject` and `UploadPartCopy`
  authorized the destination write only, so a user with write access to one
  bucket could copy any object out of any other bucket and read it from their
  own. `s3:GetObject` is now required on the copy source.
- **IAM `Condition`, `NotAction` and `NotResource` are enforced.** The evaluator
  on the S3 path matched Action, Resource and Effect and ignored the rest, so a
  policy scoped to a source IP range was treated as unconditional and a
  conditional `Deny` did not deny. A complete evaluator already existed and had
  no callers. It is now the only one, request context (`aws:SourceIp`,
  `aws:username`) is passed from the S3 handler, and a condition that cannot be
  evaluated resolves conservatively: an `Allow` does not grant, a `Deny` still
  blocks.
- **STS session policies are enforced and session tokens are verified.** A
  scoped-down session resolved its permissions against the user it was derived
  from, so it inherited that user's full access and its inline policy was never
  evaluated, and `X-Amz-Security-Token` was never read at all, so the access key
  and secret alone were sufficient and any token value, or none, was accepted.
- **The Prometheus endpoint no longer exposes the bucket inventory anonymously.**
  Per-bucket series carry bucket names, object counts, sizes and quotas, which is
  the inventory `ListBuckets` requires credentials for. Anonymous scrapes now get
  the process-level metrics with those labels withheld. A scrape carrying the
  cluster secret gets everything, and `metrics.public_bucket_labels` restores the
  old behaviour.
- **The credential endpoints are throttled.** `/api/v1/auth/login` had no rate
  limit, backoff or lockout: 30 wrong passwords in a row all returned 401 with no
  delay and the correct one worked immediately after. The general rate limiter is
  off by default and sized for object traffic, so this is separate and always on:
  10 consecutive failures from an address earn a 15-minute lockout.
- **The OIDC implicit flow is disabled by default.** `POST /api/v1/auth/oidc`
  turned any valid ID token for the configured client into a dashboard session
  with no nonce binding, so a token captured from a URL fragment, or minted by an
  attacker for their own account, created a session. The authorization-code flow,
  which binds the token to a login this server started with PKCE and a
  server-sealed nonce, is unaffected and is what the dashboard uses.
  `oidc.allow_implicit_flow` re-enables the old path for a provider that supports
  nothing newer.
- **JWTs are no longer accepted from the URL on the admin API.** The `?token=`
  fallback existed for browser download links and applied to every route, so a
  token that leaked through a proxy log, browser history or a Referer header
  worked anywhere. It is now accepted only on the download routes that need it.
- `golang.org/x/text` upgraded to v0.39.0 for CVE-2026-56852, an infinite loop on
  invalid UTF-8. The package is not imported by application code, so this is
  supply-chain hygiene rather than a reachable bug.

**Operator actions.**

1. **Rotate the admin credentials on any deployment that has ever run with
   `vaults3-secret-change-me`.** 4.4.55 stopped shipping that secret, but an
   installation that already booted with it has it persisted, and persisted
   credentials win over configuration, so upgrading does not replace it. Set
   `VAULTS3_ACCESS_KEY` and `VAULTS3_SECRET_KEY`, or change the password from the
   dashboard, which now also rotates the signing key.
2. **Set `cluster.secret` before upgrading a clustered deployment.** A clustered
   server now refuses to start without one. The Helm chart already derives it
   from the admin secret, so chart users need no action.
3. **Every existing dashboard session is invalidated** by the signing-key change.
   Users log in again once.
4. If you scrape `/metrics` anonymously and rely on the per-bucket series, either
   send the cluster secret with the scrape or set `metrics.public_bucket_labels`.

Several other fixes tighten authorization and can look like regressions: the
OIDC implicit flow is off, migrations from private addresses are blocked, STS
session policies and session tokens are enforced, a copy needs read on its
source, and IAM conditions are no longer ignored. README's **Upgrading to
4.4.56** section lists each symptom with its cause and what to do.

## [4.4.55] - 2026-08-22
### Fixed
- **A freshly downloaded binary would not start.** The release archive ships the
  two binaries, `README.md` and `LICENSE`, and the release notes say to extract
  it and run `./vaults3`. The server read `configs/vaults3.yaml` unconditionally
  and exited when it was absent, so the documented install failed on the first
  command, on every release. A config file at the DEFAULT path is now optional:
  its absence is an ordinary first run, and the built-in defaults are already a
  working single node. A config path given explicitly with `-config` must still
  exist, because there a missing file means a typo rather than a first run
  (issue #51, reported by tsundara).
- **The first thing a new user saw was a URL they could not open.** The startup
  line printed the bind address, so a default install advertised its dashboard
  at `http://0.0.0.0:9000/dashboard/`. A wildcard bind is where the server
  listens, not somewhere a browser can go. It now prints `127.0.0.1` for a
  wildcard.
- **Relative paths did not work inside the container.** The image set no working
  directory, so `./data` and friends resolved at `/`, which the unprivileged
  runtime user cannot write to. The image now has a writable working directory.
  The server itself was never affected: the image points it at absolute paths.

### Security
- **A server told no admin secret now generates its own** instead of falling
  back to `vaults3-secret-change-me`, which is printed in this repository.
  Anyone who downloaded VaultS3, started it and exposed port 9000 was running a
  server whose password is public, and a warning in the log is not a control:
  the people most likely to miss it are exactly the people who never set a
  secret. The generated secret is stored with the metadata and printed once, so
  later starts reuse it.
  - **Nothing is taken away from an existing installation.** Credentials already
    persisted, which includes any password set from the dashboard and anything a
    previous start saved, still win over everything else, and an explicitly
    configured secret is still honoured. Only an installation that has never had
    a secret gets a generated one.
  - The sample config, the Helm chart and the Kubernetes manifest no longer
    carry the example secret in the places that are overridden at runtime, and
    the chart's `auth.secretKey` now defaults to empty, which makes
    `helm install` generate one and preserve it across upgrades.
- A server still running the published example secret says so on every start,
  rather than only when it also uses the default access key.

### Added
- **`vaults3 setup`**, an interactive first-run command (issue #51). It asks for
  the data, metadata and log locations, the listen address and port, the admin
  credentials and any buckets to create at startup, creates the directories,
  and writes a config file. It writes only what you chose, so clustering,
  encryption, replication and the rest stay out of the file rather than
  appearing as a wall of disabled blocks. The file is written `0600` because it
  holds the admin secret, an existing config is never overwritten without
  `--force`, and the run ends by printing the start command, the dashboard URL
  and the credentials.
  - `--non-interactive` takes every answer from flags for scripted installs, and
    is also what a piped stdin selects, so `setup` never blocks in a pipeline.
- `vaults3 help` and a usage message that names the subcommands.

### Internal
- Fixed a data race in the transport mux test helper, which set the handshake
  timeout after the accept loop that reads it had already started. The shipped
  binary never wrote that field after construction, so no released build was
  affected, but `go test -race` failed. It is now a constructor parameter.

## [4.4.54] - 2026-08-22
### Fixed
- **A write whose metadata could not be recorded is no longer reported as
  successful.** The object PUT path called `PutObjectMeta` and discarded the
  error, then answered `200 OK` with a valid ETag regardless. In a cluster that
  write goes through Raft, so a group with no leader failed it while the bytes
  were already on disk: the client believed the object existed, it never appeared
  in a listing, its `GET` returned 404 forever, and the bytes were left orphaned.
  Every metadata write on the request path (PUT, versioned PUT, copy, multipart
  complete, POST form upload, delete, delete markers, object lock and retention,
  tagging) is now checked and answers `503 SlowDown`, which every mainstream SDK
  retries. Multi-object delete reports the failure per key instead of listing the
  key as deleted. Found while reviewing the metadata architecture for issue #50.
- **Deleting a delete marker now restores the object.** S3 says removing the
  current delete marker makes the previous version current again. Two faults sat
  in that path: the "latest" pointer was never repointed, so the object stayed
  invisible although live versions remained, and the promotion took the first
  entry of a version listing, which is the OLDEST version, so repointing alone
  would have resurrected a stale copy. New `LatestObjectVersion` seeks the newest
  version directly instead of scanning. Reproduced against the released build
  before fixing.
- **Multi-object delete ignored versioning, and destroyed objects that predated
  it.** `POST /{bucket}?delete` removed the data and the "latest" pointer
  unconditionally, whatever the bucket's versioning state, while a single
  `DELETE` on the same bucket correctly wrote a delete marker and kept the data.
  Three consequences, all silent, and the response reported `Deleted` in every
  case:
  - On a versioned bucket the object vanished with **no delete marker**, so S3's
    undelete (remove the marker) did not exist for it, while its versions stayed
    on disk reachable only by naming a version id.
  - An object written **before** versioning was enabled has no version to fall
    back on, so its bytes were removed outright with nothing to restore from.
    Enabling versioning on an existing bucket and then running a bulk delete
    therefore destroyed exactly the objects the owner had just moved to protect.
  - A `<VersionId>` in the request was ignored, so a caller asking to permanently
    remove one version instead had the current object deleted and every version
    left in place.

  Both delete paths now go through one `deleteOneObject`, so they cannot drift
  apart again, and the result carries `VersionId`, `DeleteMarker` and
  `DeleteMarkerVersionId` as S3 specifies. Multi-object delete is what Spark and
  Hadoop S3A clean up with, so an ordinary workload reached this.

  **Operators will see this in their storage numbers.** A bulk delete on a
  versioning-enabled bucket no longer frees space, because the data is now kept
  behind the delete marker. Reclaim it by expiring noncurrent versions with a
  lifecycle rule, or by deleting versions explicitly. Buckets without versioning
  are unaffected.
- **A multi-object delete of 1000 keys with long names could be rejected as
  malformed.** The request body was capped at 256 KiB, under the 1 MiB a legal
  1000-key request can reach. The cap is now 4 MiB, the same shape as the
  `CompleteMultipartUpload` body cap fixed in 4.4.5.
- **A follower could not forward a write to its leader unless the API was on port
  9000.** The Raft address carries the raft port and says nothing about the API
  port, and the conversion between them assumed 9000 unconditionally, so on any
  other port every write that landed on a follower failed with a connection
  refused. It now prefers the leader's `cluster.peer_apis` entry, then this
  node's `api_port`, then 9000, so the previous behaviour is unchanged where the
  old assumption held. Found while smoke-testing a three-node cluster on one host.
- **`storage reclaim` can no longer delete data it failed to ask about.** The
  lookup returned a plain boolean, so "the metadata store errored" was
  indistinguishable from "there is no metadata" and the file was recorded as an
  orphan and removed. Presence is now three-valued (present, absent, unknown),
  deletions are held until a bucket's scan finishes so discovery order cannot
  decide whether data survives, and a single unanswerable lookup marks the whole
  bucket incomplete and protects everything in it. Reports carry
  `skippedUnknown` and `incomplete` so an operator can see that a scan was
  partial rather than reading it as "nothing to reclaim". This is the issue #47
  rule (only delete what is positively understood) made structural.

### Performance
- **Clustered metadata writes are batched into one transaction.** The Raft state
  machine applied each committed entry in its own BoltDB transaction, costing one
  fsync per object on every node. It now implements `raft.BatchingFSM` and
  coalesces consecutive object-metadata writes, preserving log order exactly.
  Measured on a 3-node cluster ingesting 1 KiB objects at concurrency 32:
  **515 to 666 objects/sec (+29%)**, and 461 to 665 (+44%) on a shorter run. With
  Raft removed entirely the same load reaches 886/sec, so consensus now costs
  about 25% rather than dominating.

### Added
- **Sharded metadata (issue #50), off by default.** Until now a cluster spread
  object DATA across its nodes but Raft-replicated the metadata to every one of
  them, so adding nodes bought data capacity and no metadata capacity at all:
  about 600 bytes per object, on every node, is what caps how many objects a
  cluster can hold. Setting `cluster.metadata_shards` above 1 splits object
  metadata across that many independent Raft groups, and each node runs only the
  groups it is a member of.
  - Buckets map to a shard by hash. Buckets, IAM, policies and multipart state
    stay in a control group that still spans every node, so authorization and
    request routing need no lookup and the request path is unchanged.
  - The hop to another node lives inside the metadata store, not in the request
    router: data placement and metadata placement are independent, and the S3
    handler gets exactly one proxy hop, which the data placement already spends.
  - Writes are ordered by the shard's leader and listings are served by it, so a
    key a client was just told was stored cannot be missing from the next listing.
  - **A shard that cannot be asked is reported as unavailable, never as empty.**
    Reads of its buckets answer `503`, not `404`. Metadata is authoritative for
    reconciliation here, so "I could not ask" being read as "it does not exist" is
    how orphan reclaim deletes live data.
  - The assignment is Raft-committed control state with a creation epoch and
    frozen founding members, and only a founder may bootstrap a shard's group. A
    node that joined later is added to the group that exists, because a second
    bootstrap would form a rival group that answers, authoritatively, that the
    shard is empty.
  - Membership is reconciled per shard, one member at a time and adds before
    removes, so a group never drops below the quorum of members holding its data.
  - Several Raft groups share one node's Raft port. Shard connections announce
    themselves, control connections do not, which is exactly what an older build
    sends, so a rolling upgrade cannot split the control group.
  - The shard count is fixed once the assignment is committed, and sharding
    cannot be enabled on a cluster that already holds object metadata: the server
    refuses to start rather than leave those records where nothing reads them.
    See `upstream-docs/design/sharded-metadata.md`.
- `vaults3-cli cluster shards` and `GET /api/v1/cluster/shards` report how object
  metadata is distributed: the committed assignment, and the shard groups running
  on the node answering. On a cluster that replicates all metadata they say
  exactly that and what it costs, rather than reporting an empty assignment that
  would read as "sharded and holding nothing".
- `cluster.metadata_shards` and `cluster.metadata_replicas` settings, with
  `cluster.metadataShards` / `cluster.metadataReplicas` in the Helm chart.
- `upstream-docs/SCALING.md` section 11a, "how many objects a cluster can hold", with the
  measured cost of the metadata index and what it means for planning, and
  `upstream-docs/design/sharded-metadata.md` with the design, the measured numbers behind
  it, and the constraints an adversarial review of it established.

### Changed
- **Bucket deletion is two commits, object metadata first.** A bucket's object
  records can live in a different Raft group from the bucket record, so removing
  the bucket while that group is unreachable would strand records nothing owns,
  which a bucket recreated under the same name would inherit. The delete now
  fails with `503` instead.
- Background subsystems (lifecycle, tiering, search, the scanner, replication,
  backup, inventory, batch operations, the rebalancer, the erasure healer) take
  the metadata store interface rather than the concrete local store, so they see
  the routed object space. With sharding on, full scans are partitioned across
  shard leaders: each leader walks the shards it leads, so the cluster visits
  every object once instead of every node walking everything.
- The control group now uses the same shared Raft transport as shard groups.
  Control connections are byte-identical to what earlier builds send, so this is
  invisible on the wire and there is one transport path rather than two.

## [4.4.53] - 2026-08-13
### Fixed
- **Encrypted reads no longer allocate in proportion to object size**, which is
  what OOM-killed replicas serving a large object to a handful of concurrent
  readers (issue #49, reported by vikram-a-m). Encryption at rest sealed each
  object as one AES-256-GCM message. A single tag over the whole object cannot be
  verified incrementally, so every `GET` read the entire ciphertext and allocated
  the entire plaintext before sending a byte, and peak memory scaled with object
  size times concurrent readers. Object count never mattered, which is why 32
  concurrent readers of 2.2 MiB objects were fine while 8 readers of one 643 MiB
  object were not.
  - Objects are now sealed in 1 MiB chunks (the STREAM construction used by age
    and Tink: the nonce binds each chunk to its index and marks the final one, so
    chunks cannot be reordered and truncation is detected). Each chunk is
    authenticated before any of its bytes are served, so no unverified plaintext
    reaches a client.
  - Measured on one node, 643 MiB object, 3 GiB limit: peak `anon` went from
    **2661 MiB with a single reader, OOMKilled at two**, to **15 MiB at one
    reader and 31 MiB at eight**. Writes improved with it, 2010 MiB to 15 MiB.
  - Applies to SSE-S3, SSE-KMS and per-bucket encryption. The 1 GiB object-size
    cap on encryption no longer applies to newly written objects.
  - A full read never seeks the underlying reader. That matters on a bucket that
    is both compressed and encrypted, where a single seek makes the decompressor
    materialise the whole object (the codecs are not seekable): 128 MiB at 8
    readers costs 45 MiB rather than 2257 MiB.
  - **Objects written by earlier versions are still read.** They keep the
    whole-object format, so reading one still costs roughly its own size;
    rewriting an object migrates it to the streaming format. Reading the old
    format now takes one copy rather than three.
  - Not covered: SSE-C (customer-supplied keys) still seals an object as one
    message and still buffers it.

### Documentation
- Corrected a long-standing README and code claim that data is "compressed then
  encrypted". The wrapping is the other way round, so the compressor only ever
  sees ciphertext and **compression saves nothing while encryption at rest is
  enabled** (measured 1.00x on a highly repetitive 1.12 MB payload). Enabling
  both costs CPU for no saving. Behaviour is unchanged, and pre-dates this
  release; reordering the two would change the on-disk layering and needs its own
  change.

## [4.4.52] - 2026-08-10
### Security
- Dashboard dependencies updated to clear two high-severity advisories:
  `react-router` / `react-router-dom` 7.18.1 to 7.18.2 (GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2, a
  CSRF bypass in the unstable RSC code paths) and `nanoid` 3.3.16 to 3.3.18
  (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8) via `postcss`. Neither was reachable in VaultS3: the
  dashboard does not use React Router's RSC APIs, and `postcss` is a
  build-time-only devDependency, so `nanoid` never reaches the browser bundle.
  Lockfile only, no source changes. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities.

### Documentation
- Recorded the first real-world cluster memory measurement and separated it from
  the single-node figure: 64 MiB objects under sustained PUT load cost ~20 MiB of
  `anon` on one node but ~1.85 GiB on a 12-pod cluster member (user-reported on
  4.4.51), because a clustered node also forwards bodies to the owner and fans
  replicas out to peers. The `<80 MB RAM` headline is explicitly a small
  single-node figure; size cluster pods from your own measurement, and measure a
  restart as well as a load test.


## [4.4.51] - 2026-08-08
### Fixed
- **A node no longer allocates in proportion to the cluster's metadata while it
  starts up**, which is what OOM-killed pods during their own startup/join phase
  before they served a single request (issue #46 follow-up, reported by
  kesavkolla). Installing a Raft snapshot is the first thing a joining or
  restarting node does, and it ran as one BoltDB write transaction. Bolt holds
  every dirty page of a transaction in memory until it commits, so peak memory
  scaled with the total number of objects.
  - The restore now commits in bounded batches. Measured peak RSS restoring a
    snapshot: at 400k objects **559 MiB to 60 MiB**, at 1.6M objects **2175 MiB
    to 66 MiB**. It is now flat in the size of the data rather than linear.
  - Restoring is deliberately no longer atomic, so an interrupted restore leaves
    a partial database. That is recorded, detected on the next open, and
    discarded, after which the cluster sends the snapshot again. Serving a
    partial restore would have presented a subset of the objects as the whole
    set.

### Note on the load-time half of issue #46
The streaming-upload fix released in 4.4.48 is working. Measured on one node with
a 4 GiB limit, 64 MiB objects at 64 concurrent uploads, sampling cgroup v2
`memory.stat`:

| build | anon (real memory) | outcome | throughput |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.4.44 | 2253 MiB | OOMKilled (exit 137), every request failed | 65 MiB/s |
| 4.4.48 | 22 MiB | survived, no errors | 956 MiB/s |
| 4.4.50 | 20 MiB | survived, no errors | 1021 MiB/s |

If you are watching `memory.current` (or `container_memory_usage_bytes`) it will
sit near the limit under write load and that is expected: it **includes page
cache**, which the kernel fills with written object data and reclaims on demand.
It is also misleading in this case, because the build that OOM-killed showed a
*lower* `memory.current` (1804 MiB) than the healthy one (4094 MiB) — it died
before the cache could accumulate. Alert on `anon`, or on working set
(`memory.current` minus `inactive_file`), not on `memory.current`.

## [4.4.50] - 2026-08-07
### Fixed
- **Re-uploading a part no longer destroys the copy that already succeeded**,
  which is what left multipart uploads permanently stuck on
  `400 InvalidPart "Part N not found"` (issue #48, reported by vikram-a-m).
  `UploadPart` wrote straight to the part path, so `os.Create` truncated whatever
  was already there and the copy-error path deleted it outright, while the
  earlier success's part metadata survived. After that the upload could never
  complete: `ListParts` still advertised the part with its original ETag,
  `CompleteMultipartUpload` could not open it, and no number of retries recovered.
  - Any failed transfer was enough to trigger it, a dropped connection, a read
    timeout, a cut-short proxy retry or a client cancel, which is why it tracked
    dropped connections and memory pressure rather than data volume, and why a
    retrying client or proxy in front (Envoy, DuckDB `httpfs`) made it routine.
  - Parts are now written to a temp file and renamed into place only once
    complete, the same way object writes already worked, so a failed attempt
    leaves any previously uploaded copy of that part exactly as it was and never
    leaves a short part behind. `UploadPartCopy` takes the same path.
  - A part write's `Close` error is now checked rather than deferred away, so a
    failure that only surfaces on flush cannot be reported to the client as a
    stored part.
- **A part that cannot be read for a server-side reason no longer reports
  `InvalidPart`.** Every `os.Open` failure was turned into
  `400 InvalidPart`, so running out of file descriptors or hitting an I/O error
  told the client its request was malformed and every SDK correctly refused to
  retry a condition a retry would have survived. Only a genuinely absent part is
  `InvalidPart` now; anything else is a `500`.
- **A missing part is now logged.** This failure was completely silent server
  side, which is why it could only be diagnosed from client-side evidence. The
  log names the bucket, key, upload, part and what to do about it.
- `CompleteMultipartUpload` now deletes the upload record before removing the
  part files. Stopping between those two steps (an OOM kill, an eviction) used to
  leave the record advertising parts whose files were already gone, which is the
  same unrecoverable `InvalidPart` state. The new order fails the other way
  instead, leaving unreachable part files that `vaults3-cli storage reclaim`
  cleans up.

## [4.4.49] - 2026-08-05
### Fixed
- **Deleted data is now actually freed on every node**, closing a leak that grew a
  cluster's disk use without bound under delete-heavy workloads (issue #47,
  reported by kesavkolla). The multi-object delete (`POST /{bucket}?delete`, what
  Hadoop/Spark S3A uses by default) is a *bucket*-level request, so a cluster
  routed it by `hash(bucket, "")` to a single node. That node removed the metadata
  cluster-wide through Raft but deleted the data file only from its own disk, so
  every key whose data lived elsewhere was orphaned: not listed, not readable, not
  deletable by any S3 call. On an N-node cluster this stranded **(N-1)/N of every
  bulk-deleted byte** (67% on 3 nodes, 92% on 12).
  - Measured on a 3-node cluster: deleting all 40 test objects previously left 14
    orphan files behind; it now leaves **zero on every node**.
  - The same omission is fixed in the lifecycle expiry sweep (whichever node swept
    first hid the object from the others, stranding their copies), in
    specific-version deletes, and in suspended-versioning null-version deletes.
    The reaper is now version-aware.
  - The multi-object delete reaps with a single request per peer carrying the whole
    key list, so a 1000-key batch costs one call per node rather than one per node
    per key.
- **Multipart uploads are no longer invisible or unabortable in a cluster** (issue
  #47). In-progress multipart state is deliberately node-local (issue #32) while
  these requests route by object key, which broke two things:
  - `ListMultipartUploads` is bucket-level, so it only ever showed the uploads
    whose key hashed to the listing node, roughly **1/N of them**. The rest could
    not be listed, inspected, aborted, or cleaned by a lifecycle rule, and their
    parts sat on disk forever. The listing now merges every node's uploads. On a
    3-node cluster: **3 of 12 listed before, 12 of 12 after**.
  - After any hash-ring change (adding or removing a node) an upload stayed on its
    creating node while `AbortMultipartUpload` and `ListParts` routed to the key's
    new owner, which answered `NoSuchUpload` forever. Such an upload was a
    permanent phantom: listed, but impossible to remove. Requests naming an upload
    this node does not hold are now forwarded to the node that does. Reproduced by
    adding a 4th node mid-upload: **1 permanent phantom before, 0 after**, with all
    parts freed.

### Added
- `vaults3-cli storage reclaim` and `POST /api/v1/reclaim` find object data on
  disk that no metadata refers to any more, and with `--apply` delete it. This is
  how a cluster that ran the older builds gets the already-stranded space back,
  since no S3 operation can reach those files. It fans out across every node,
  because a node can only see its own disk.
  - Dry run is the default. Nothing newer than `--min-age` (default 24h) is ever
    touched, because a `PUT` writes its data before its metadata commits and a
    brand new object is briefly indistinguishable from an orphan.
  - Only files with **no metadata at all** are candidates. A file whose object
    still exists is left alone even on a node that is not its hash owner, since
    with `replica_count > 1` those copies are load-bearing.
  - Small-object packing volumes (`_volumes/`) and erasure-coded shards
    (`<bucket>/.ec/`) are explicitly out of scope, since neither maps to a
    plain-object metadata entry.
  - Unreachable nodes are reported and counted, so a partial scan is never read as
    a complete one.

### Changed
- The startup log line for compression said `algorithm=gzip`. Writes have been
  zstd since 4.4.36; it now reports `algorithm=zstd reads=zstd+gzip`, which is what
  actually happens (older gzip objects are still read). Same correction in
  `DOCKERHUB.md`.

## [4.4.48] - 2026-08-01
### Fixed
- **Uploads no longer hold the whole object in memory**, which is what OOM-killed
  pods under high-concurrency large-object load (issue #46, reported by
  kesavkolla). A `PUT` was read fully into the handler to validate its checksums,
  and with compression enabled the engine then held the plaintext and the
  compressed copy as well, so peak memory scaled with **object size x
  concurrency** rather than with concurrency alone.
  - The body now streams to the storage engine while its digests are computed in
    passing. Only the digests the request actually asks about are computed.
  - Compression streams too, encoding as the object flows through instead of
    buffering the plaintext and the result.
  - Measured on a 4 GiB container with zstd compression, 64 MiB objects, 16
    concurrent uploads: peak **3.9 GiB to 1.4 GiB** at c=8 and **6.1 GiB to 2.8
    GiB** at c=16. The same run that OOM-killed the previous build (exit 137) now
    completes with ~1.3 GiB to spare, and PUT throughput improved as a side effect.
  - Validation now happens after the bytes are written rather than before, so a
    rejected upload is deleted again. A bad checksum still returns exactly the
    same `BadDigest` / `InvalidDigest` error, and the object never becomes
    visible: metadata is written only after validation and metadata is
    authoritative (issue #34).
  - Two paths still buffer deliberately, because they cannot not: SSE-C seals an
    object as a single AEAD message, and an upload with no declared length cannot
    have its size recorded in the compression frame header.
  - The zstd frame content size is still written on every object. Streaming reads
    depend on it (issue #38) and would silently fall back to buffering the whole
    object without it; a test now fails if it ever goes missing.

### Changed
- The scaling guide previously called large-object OOMKills "an operational
  limit, not a server bug". That was wrong, and it now documents the real
  per-request memory cost, what changed in 4.4.48, and which paths still buffer.
- The benchmarking guide's memory section now says that object size and
  concurrency set the peak, so a RAM figure measured with small objects is not
  the number to size a container from.

## [4.4.47] - 2026-08-01
### Added
- **VaultS3 now measures its own on-disk footprint**, so "how much are my objects
  really costing" is answered with a number instead of an inference (issue #43,
  follow-up reported by kesavkolla). The dashboard Stats panel, `vaults3-cli info`
  and `GET /api/v1/cluster/info` present three sizes side by side and say what each
  one counts:
  - **Logical**: each object's current version, counted once cluster-wide.
  - **VaultS3 on disk**: what its data, metadata, erasure, cold-tier and Raft
    directories actually occupy, summed per node. This is the figure to compare
    against logical for a real amplification ratio (replicas, parity shards,
    non-current versions), and it is shown as an explicit multiple.
  - **Filesystems**: `statfs` of the whole volumes, which also counts the operating
    system, container images, logs, and any other tenant of the same disk.

  The panel stacks VaultS3's share and everything else on one bar, so the gap
  between an object total and a much larger "used" figure is visible rather than
  suspicious. A per-directory breakdown separates object data from metadata and
  Raft logs, which is what distinguishes real growth from a busy volume.
- Sizes are allocated blocks, matching `du`, so a bucket full of small objects
  shows the block-rounding cost it genuinely pays. Hardlinks are counted once and
  symlinks are not followed.
- The walk runs in the background and is cached: `storage.usage_scan_interval_secs`
  (env `VAULTS3_USAGE_SCAN_INTERVAL_SECS`, Helm `usageScanIntervalSecs`, default
  300) caps how often it may repeat, `0` disables it. It never runs on a request.
  The dashboard and CLI show how old the measurement is.
- New Prometheus series: `vaults3_disk_usage_bytes{dir=...}`,
  `vaults3_disk_usage_files{dir=...}`, `vaults3_disk_usage_bytes_total` and
  `vaults3_disk_usage_scanned_timestamp_seconds`, so physical growth can be graphed
  next to the logical `vaults3_storage_size_bytes_total`.

### Fixed
- **A clustered node addressed every peer as itself when peers shared a host on
  different ports**, because the membership sync rebuilt each peer's API address
  from its Raft address plus *this* node's API port, discarding the configured
  `cluster.peer_apis`. One node per IP (the usual Kubernetes shape) was unaffected,
  but a single-host or host-networked cluster silently sent all inter-node traffic
  back to itself: **object replicas were never placed on peers despite
  `replica_count: 3`**, rebalance moved nothing, and the capacity rollup reported
  one node's disk usage once per node. Explicitly configured peer addresses now win
  over derived ones; this node's own entry stays derived, since the configured form
  is a bind address that may be a wildcard. Existing objects written before the fix
  stay single-copy until `vaults3-cli cluster rebalance`.
- The Raft directory was missing from the reported storage directories, so its log
  and snapshot growth was invisible in capacity numbers on a clustered node.

### Changed
- The Stats card previously labelled "Total Storage" is now "Logical Storage", and
  the capacity panel names each figure, rather than leaving two very different
  numbers labelled "storage" next to each other.
- The Stats page had a handful of strings the i18n sweep missed (the auto-refresh
  toggle, the capacity legend, per-bucket quota lines); they are translated now.
- Settings shows the footprint scan interval.

## [4.4.46] - 2026-08-01
### Added
- **The dashboard is now translated** (issue #33, requested by autool). It ships
  **English, German, French, and Simplified Chinese**, picks a language from the
  browser on first load, and offers a switcher in the top bar that remembers the
  choice. `<html lang>` follows the selection, so screen readers pronounce the UI
  correctly and browsers stop offering to translate an already-translated page.
  - All 517 user-facing strings across the 19 pages and 16 components go through
    a translation lookup, including button labels, table headers, placeholders,
    tooltips, empty states, toasts, and error messages.
  - Implemented without adding a dependency: a ~120-line provider next to the
    existing theme provider, plus one flat JSON file per language. The dashboard
    still has three runtime dependencies.
  - **Adding a language is one JSON file and no code**, see
    [Translating the dashboard](CONTRIBUTING.md#translating-the-dashboard). A key
    a translation is missing falls back to English at runtime, so a partial
    translation never breaks the UI, and `npx vitest run` checks that every
    shipped locale has all the English keys, none that English does not define,
    and the same `{placeholders}` in every string.
  - The German, French, and Chinese files were drafted without a native-speaker
    review and corrections are welcome as PRs. Server-side messages (S3 API
    errors, log lines) remain English.
  - All locales are bundled up front rather than fetched on demand, which costs
    about 17 kB gzipped for the three added languages (123 kB to 140 kB) and
    avoids an untranslated flash on load. Worth revisiting if many more languages
    arrive.
  - Helm chart 0.1.6, appVersion 4.4.46.

## [4.4.45] - 2026-08-01
### Added
- **Buckets can be created on startup from configuration** (issue #45, requested
  by beeyev), so a container deployment no longer needs an init container or a
  separate S3 client just to get its first bucket:
  `VAULTS3_DEFAULT_BUCKETS=app-data,backups`, or `storage.default_buckets` in
  `vaults3.yaml`, or `defaultBuckets` in the Helm chart.
  - Missing buckets are created through the same metadata and storage path as
    `PUT /{bucket}`, so they are ordinary buckets in every respect.
  - A bucket that already exists is left completely alone, and removing a name
    from the list deletes nothing, so the setting is safe to leave in place across
    restarts and upgrades. The setting means "these buckets must exist", so
    deleting a bucket whose name is still listed brings it back, empty, on the
    next restart.
  - An invalid bucket name stops startup before anything is created, with an error
    naming the bucket and the rule it broke. A create that fails stops startup too,
    rather than letting the deployment come up quietly missing a bucket its
    workload expects.
  - On a cluster the creation is a replicated write like any other, so several
    nodes booting with the same setting converge on one bucket. A node that starts
    before the cluster has a leader waits and retries instead of failing.
  - Verified in Docker: a fresh container; a restart with one bucket added and one
    removed, leaving a manually created bucket and its objects intact; four kinds
    of invalid name and a read-only data directory (all exit non-zero with a
    message naming the bucket and the cause); a startup-created bucket taking
    versioning, a policy, object versions and a delete like any other; and a 3-node
    cluster where every node reported the buckets and served reads and writes for
    them, including a node started before any leader existed and one that could
    never reach a quorum.
  - Helm chart 0.1.5 (`defaultBuckets`), appVersion 4.4.45.

## [4.4.44] - 2026-07-31
### Added
- **Erasure coding and replica count can now be set per bucket** (issue #39,
  requested by kesavkolla), so a bucket holding data that is cheap to recreate can
  be stored once while the buckets that matter keep their parity and copies. Both
  settings are independent, and a bucket that sets neither follows the server
  defaults.
  - `PUT /{bucket}?durability` with `{"erasure_enabled": false, "replica_count": 1}`,
    `GET /{bucket}?durability` to read what is in force, and
    `vaults3-cli bucket durability <bucket> [--erasure=on|off|default] [--replicas=N|default]`.
    Either field may be null to go back to inheriting the default. The resolved
    settings also appear on `GET /api/v1/buckets/{name}`.
  - Measured on a live 3-node cluster with erasure 4+2 and `replica_count: 3`, the
    same 4 MiB of data occupied **18.1 MiB** with the defaults (4.52x: three copies
    of a 1.5x-coded object), **12.0 MiB** with erasure off, **6.0 MiB** with one
    replica, and **4.0 MiB** with both turned off, all read back byte-identical.
  - Only later writes are affected. Objects already stored keep the layout they
    were written with, which is safe because reads detect an object's layout from
    the object itself, so a bucket may hold both kinds at once. Lowering a replica
    count leaves surplus copies on nodes that are no longer holders; those are
    reclaimed when the object is deleted or a rebalance runs. Verified on a live
    cluster by moving a bucket through both settings in both directions and
    re-reading every object from every node after each change (224 reads, none
    became unreadable).
  - A bucket that opts out of erasure coding also skips the whole-object buffering
    that encoding requires, so its writes stream straight to disk.

### Fixed
- **`go vet` failure in the OIDC code-flow tests** introduced in 4.4.43: the test
  provider was passed by value while containing a mutex (`copylocks`). Test-only,
  no effect on the server, but it broke CI.

## [4.4.43] - 2026-07-31
### Added
- **SSO now uses the authorization-code flow with PKCE** (issue #44). VaultS3 only
  supported the implicit flow, which returns the token through the browser's URL,
  is deprecated by OAuth 2.1, and has to be explicitly turned on for a client on
  both Keycloak and Authentik — so on a normally configured provider the login had
  no way to complete. The flow is now chosen from the provider's discovery document,
  so a provider that only offers implicit keeps working; pin it with
  `oidc.flow: code|implicit` if you need to.
  - The PKCE verifier, the nonce and the client secret stay on the server. The
    browser only ever carries a code and a state sealed with AES-GCM, so a login
    started on one cluster node can be completed on another.
  - New `oidc.client_secret` (env: `VAULTS3_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`) for confidential
    clients, which is the default client type on both providers. Leave it empty for
    a public client authenticated by PKCE alone.
  - Verified by signing in end to end against a real **Keycloak 26** and a real
    **Authentik 2024.10** in Docker: a real user typing a real password through each
    provider's own login flow, then the back-channel token exchange. On both, the
    URL the old code built returns 404.

### Fixed
- **SSO login now works with providers that serve a global authorize endpoint**
  (issue #44, reported by makayel). The dashboard built the login URL by appending
  `/authorize` to the configured `issuer_url`. Authentik, Keycloak and Auth0 all give
  each application its own issuer while serving authorization at one shared path, so
  the button opened a URL that does not exist: an issuer of
  `https://idp/application/o/my-app` produced `.../my-app/authorize`, a 404, and the
  login never started. The authorization endpoint is now taken from the provider's
  OpenID Connect discovery document, which is where it is published. Providers that
  omit it fall back to the previous `{issuer}/authorize`, so existing deployments are
  unaffected.
- **An ID token whose issuer differs only by a trailing slash is no longer rejected.**
  Authentik publishes its issuer as `.../my-app/` while an operator naturally
  configures it without the slash, and the exact string comparison failed every token
  with `invalid issuer` — the error waiting immediately behind the one above. The
  issuer is now taken from the discovery document and compared ignoring a trailing
  slash. A token from a genuinely different issuer is still rejected, and a discovery
  document whose issuer does not match the configured one is ignored with a warning
  rather than trusted.
- **The requested scopes are negotiated with the provider instead of hardcoded.**
  VaultS3 always asked for `openid email profile groups`, and a provider that does
  not define a `groups` scope rejects the whole request: a stock Keycloak answers
  `error=invalid_scope, Invalid scopes: openid email profile groups` and never shows
  a login page. Only scopes the provider advertises in `scopes_supported` are now
  requested, so group-to-policy mapping still works where groups exist and login no
  longer fails where they do not. Pin them with `oidc.scopes` if your provider needs
  a specific set.
- **`GET /api/v1/auth/me` reports the signed-in user rather than always "admin".**
  A user signed in through SSO saw themselves as the admin account and was shown its
  masked access key. Authorization was never affected — that is keyed on the token's
  subject, so an SSO user was never granted admin rights — but the answer was wrong
  and the access key should not have been shown to them.

## [4.4.42] - 2026-07-31
### Fixed
- **The dashboard's cluster capacity panel no longer multiplies logical storage usage
  by the node count** (issue #43, reported by kesavkolla). Object metadata is
  replicated by Raft, so every node reports the same cluster-wide logical totals, and
  the rollup added them up: a 12-node cluster holding 82.2 GB in 395,999 objects
  reported 986.4 GB in 4,751,988 objects in the capacity panel, directly below the
  card showing the correct figure — inflated by exactly 12x. Logical size is now
  counted once, while physical disk is still summed across nodes, where replicas
  genuinely do occupy separate disks.

### Changed
- **The capacity panel now says what its two numbers measure.** Disk usage is read from
  the filesystems backing the data directories, so it counts every replica and erasure
  shard, non-current object versions, in-progress multipart parts, and anything else
  stored on those disks; logical size counts each object's current version once. The
  two are routinely far apart, and side by side without explanation they read as a
  contradiction rather than as answers to different questions.

## [4.4.41] - 2026-07-31
### Fixed
- **A clustered `GET` no longer returns "not found" for an object that was just
  written** (issue #42, reported by vikram-a-m). Object metadata is replicated
  through Raft and reaches every node at once, but the object's bytes are pushed to
  the other replica holders in the background. Any holder may serve a read, so a
  `GET` that landed on a holder inside that window was answered from metadata that
  said the object existed and a disk that did not have it yet. A read that cannot
  find its data locally now asks the holders that have it before giving up, and the
  window scaled with object size: in a 3-node cluster under load, 64 KiB objects
  missed on ~2% of reads and 4 MiB objects on 43%. This is also the desync behind
  the rclone "object not found but it exists" reports in issue #40.
- **A failed hop between cluster nodes is retried instead of becoming a
  `502 Bad Gateway`.** A pooled connection the peer had already closed, a peer whose
  accept queue was briefly full, or a pod restarting each surfaced directly to the
  client as a 502 that succeeded on the caller's own retry. The forwarding proxy now
  retries such a hop, and falls through to the object's other data holders, whenever
  it failed before any response byte reached the client. A hop that fails midway
  through a response is never replayed.
- **Forwarded uploads are no longer cut off after 10 seconds.** An upload's response
  headers arrive only once the whole body has been received and stored, so the read
  path's `ResponseHeaderTimeout` acted as a rule that no forwarded `PUT` may take
  longer than ten seconds; a large object, a slow client, or a busy peer became a 502.
  Uploads now stream without a header timeout, while reads keep the fast-fail that
  stops a hung node from parking a client.
- **Inter-node calls now share one pooled HTTP transport.** Metadata writes forwarded
  to the leader, replica data pushes, delete reaps and health probes each built their
  own client and so fell back to the default pool of 2 idle connections per host,
  opening and closing a TCP connection for most calls. A 3-node cluster doing 255
  writes/s left ~1180 sockets in `TIME_WAIT` against 55 established; that churn
  exhausts ephemeral ports and conntrack entries, which is what makes a gateway's
  connections to a busy pod fail and reset for no visible reason. Measured at 0 after
  the change.
- **A node that cannot serve a request now answers `503 SlowDown` with an S3 error
  document** instead of a plain-text `502`. The condition is temporary, and 503 is
  both the S3 idiom for "retry" and something every mainstream SDK retries on its
  own, where a 502 reached users as an unexplained "Bad Gateway". An object whose
  holder is unreachable is likewise reported as temporarily unavailable rather than
  not-found, which is a wrong answer a client cannot recover from.

### Changed
- **The Helm chart now defaults to the current image.** `appVersion` had been left at
  `4.2.17`, so `helm install` without an explicit `image.tag` deployed a build from
  well before the recent cluster fixes. It now tracks the release (chart `0.1.1`).
  Pinning `image.tag` yourself is still recommended for reproducible deploys.

Measured on a 3-node Raft cluster behind an nginx gateway, running the reported
workload (list-then-write-then-read, 10,000 writes, 40 concurrent clients):
111 disrupted operations before, 0 after. With a pod restarted mid-run: 62 before,
3 after, and all three of those were the test gateway routing to the stopped pod.

## [4.4.40] - 2026-07-28
### Security
- **Dashboard dependencies updated: `react-router`/`react-router-dom` 7.17.0 → 7.18.1
  and `postcss` 8.5.15 → 8.5.24.** This clears four react-router advisories, two of
  which affect the dashboard as it is actually built: an **open redirect via a
  backslash in `<Link>`/`useNavigate`** (GHSA-wrjc-x8rr-h8h6, a CVE-2025-68470 bypass)
  and an **unauthenticated denial of service via inefficient route matching**
  (GHSA-chx6-hx7r-mcp5). It also clears two that do not apply here (an SSR hydration
  issue and the RSCErrorHandler XSS), plus a postcss path-traversal advisory in the
  build toolchain (GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849). One advisory remains open by design: the
  **RSC Mode CSRF bypass** (GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2) is only patched in react-router 8.x
  and only affects React Server Components mode, which the dashboard does not use (it
  is a client-rendered SPA). Moving to 8.x would also require Node 22.22+ and dropping
  `react-router-dom`, so it is deferred to a deliberate upgrade rather than bundled
  into a patch release.

## [4.4.39] - 2026-07-28
### Fixed
- **Bucket policies using the standard AWS `Principal` object form now grant public
  read** (issue #41, reported by hllshiro). Public-read detection only recognised the
  shorthand `"Principal": "*"`, so the AWS-standard `{"AWS": "*"}` and `{"AWS": ["*"]}`
  forms fell through a string type assertion and anonymous `GET`/`HEAD` returned
  `403 AccessDenied`. All three spellings are now accepted. A principal naming a
  specific account, user, or service is still never treated as public.
- **Bucket policy evaluation now honours explicit `Deny` and the statement `Resource`.**
  A policy that allowed public read and also explicitly denied it was treated as
  public, and the `Resource` was ignored entirely, so a statement written for a
  different bucket could make the current one public. Deny now wins over Allow, and a
  statement only counts when its `Resource` refers to this bucket. Action matching also
  supports wildcards (`s3:*`, `s3:Get*`) via the same matcher used for IAM policies.
- **Public Access Block is now enforced.** `BlockPublicPolicy` and
  `RestrictPublicBuckets` were stored and returned by the API but never consulted, so
  turning them on did not actually stop anonymous access. A bucket with either flag set
  now denies anonymous requests regardless of its policy. Authenticated access is
  unaffected.

### Added
- **Anonymous bucket listing when the policy grants `s3:ListBucket` to everyone**
  (issue #41, follow-up). Previously only object reads could be public. Listing and
  reading are kept as separate permissions, matching S3: a policy granting only
  `s3:ListBucket` makes the listing public **without** making objects readable, and a
  policy granting only `s3:GetObject` does not expose the listing. Bucket
  sub-resources (`?policy`, `?acl`, `?versioning`, and every other configuration
  endpoint) always require authentication, so a public bucket never exposes its own
  configuration.

## [4.4.38] - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
- **Erasure-coded reads now stream, so GET time-to-first-byte no longer scales with
  object size** (issue #38, the remaining half). With erasure coding enabled, every
  read called `io.ReadAll` on *all* shards, ran Reed-Solomon reconstruction, and only
  then returned a reader over the finished buffer, so the whole object had to be read
  and reassembled before the first byte went out and TTFB grew with size (~3 ms/MiB on
  a slower disk, ~200 ms for 64 MiB). Because the code is systematic Reed-Solomon, an
  intact object is exactly the concatenation of its data shards, so reads now stream
  those shards in order and skip parity math entirely on the healthy path. Measured in
  a 3-node cluster with erasure coding (4+2) and incompressible data, TTFB went from
  8.2/20.8/39.6 ms at 8/32/64 MiB (scaling, ~0.56 ms/MiB) to a flat ~2.5 ms at every
  size, and full-object throughput improved from 258 to 309 MiB/s. Correctness is
  unchanged: if a data shard is missing or unreadable the read transparently falls back
  to full parity reconstruction, including mid-stream, and `Range`/`partNumber` reads
  seek directly to the right shard instead of materializing the object. Objects written
  by earlier versions read back byte-identical (the on-disk format did not change).
  Note that cross-shard parity verification no longer runs on every healthy read (it
  would require reading every shard, which is the cost being removed); the background
  healer remains responsible for detecting and repairing degraded objects.
  Whole-object encryption (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS/per-bucket) still buffers on read to verify
  the GCM tag before releasing plaintext, which is tracked separately.

## [4.4.37] - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
- **"Remember me" now pre-fills your credentials on the next login** (issue #40). The
  checkbox already persisted the session token (so you stayed signed in), but the
  login form always started blank, so it did not "remember credentials" the way most
  users expect. When checked, the dashboard now stores the access key (never the
  secret) and pre-fills it, with the box pre-checked, on the next visit.

### Added
- **`vaults3-cli object verify <bucket> [--prefix=<p>] [--repair]`** to find and fix a
  metadata/data desync (issue #40). If an object's metadata exists but its data is
  missing, the object lists normally but a `GET` returns "Object not found" (it looks
  present yet cannot be downloaded over S3). `verify` walks the bucket, probes each
  object with a 1-byte ranged `GET`, and reports the keys whose data is unreadable;
  `--repair` removes the orphaned metadata so the phantom stops appearing in listings.
  It never touches readable objects. The S3 `GET` path also now logs a loud `WARN`
  when it hits this desync, so it is diagnosable in server logs.

### Notes
- **Folder "Last Modified" over rclone (issue #40, follow-up to #35) is an rclone
  client limitation, not a server bug.** VaultS3 already returns a `<LastModified>` on
  `<CommonPrefixes>` (the #35 extension) and the web UI shows real folder dates, but
  rclone does not read directory timestamps from S3 listings at all, so `rclone lsd`
  shows folders with its own default date (e.g. 2000-01-01) regardless. There is
  nothing to change server-side.

## [4.4.36] - 2026-07-24
### Fixed
- **Compressed reads now stream, so GET time-to-first-byte no longer scales with
  object size** (issue #38). With compression enabled, `CompressedEngine` read the
  entire object into memory and decompressed it before emitting the first byte, so
  TTFB grew with object size (~4 ms/MiB on slower disks, e.g. ~330 ms for 64 MiB)
  even though pod-to-pod latency was sub-millisecond. Reads now wrap the stored blob
  in a streaming zstd/gzip decoder and report `Content-Length` from the size recorded
  in the container (zstd frame header, gzip trailing ISIZE) without materializing the
  object. Measured TTFB is now flat (~8 ms) from 1 MiB to 64 MiB. `Range`/`partNumber`
  reads (which seek) still buffer on demand, and blobs stored while compression was
  off stream through untouched. Note: whole-object encryption (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS/
  per-bucket) still buffers on read to verify the GCM tag before releasing plaintext;
  streaming that needs a chunked-cipher format and is tracked separately.

## [4.4.35] - 2026-07-22
### Fixed
- **Cluster read-after-write miss root-caused and fixed: bucket listings are now
  served by the Raft leader** (issue #37). The reported symptom was a `HEAD`/stat
  right after a `PUT` returning "Object not found" on a multi-node cluster while a
  `GET` for the same key succeeded. Tracing the client showed `mc stat` (and warp's
  verification) issues a `ListObjectsV2` *before* the `HEAD`, and reports the object
  missing if that list comes back empty. Object `GET`/`HEAD` are owner-routed and
  wait out replication with a per-key barrier, but a listing is bucket-wide with no
  single key to wait on: it was answered from a follower whose Raft FSM had not yet
  applied the just-committed write (the leader commits on a quorum and does not block
  on lagging followers), so the new key was absent from the list. Listings
  (`ListObjects` v1/v2, `ListObjectVersions`, and bucket sub-resource reads) are now
  forwarded to the current leader, which has every committed write applied, giving
  read-your-writes for enumerations. This uses only the leader identity Raft already
  tracks (no inter-node read-index RPC, which earlier attempts showed is unreliable
  under this topology). In-progress multipart listing (`?uploads`) stays node-local
  (issue #32) and object `GET`/`HEAD` keep owner routing.
- **`VAULTS3_TRACE_READS=1` now also logs `HEAD` 404s.** It previously logged only
  `GET` misses, so the operation that actually failed was invisible to the trace.

## [4.4.34] - 2026-07-21
### Fixed
- **`/cluster/ownership` diagnostic now reaches its handler regardless of path
  shape** (issue #37 diagnosis). It was registered only as the exact path
  `/cluster/ownership`, so a trailing slash (`/cluster/ownership/`), a path-style
  call (`/cluster/ownership/<bucket>/<key>`), or an LB that appends a slash fell
  through to the S3 bucket handler and returned `NoSuchBucket`/`AccessDenied` — which
  looked like the ownership view was reading a different store than the S3 path, when
  in fact the request never hit the endpoint. The handler is now registered for both
  the exact path and the subtree and accepts the bucket/key from either the query
  string or the path, so all call shapes return the JSON ownership view. (The exact
  query form `?bucket=&key=` already worked on v4.4.33.)

## [4.4.33] - 2026-07-20
### Added
- **`GET /cluster/ownership?bucket=&key=` diagnostic endpoint** to localize the
  residual issue #37 read-after-write miss on a large cluster. From the responding
  pod's own view it returns the key's `owner`, the data `holders`, where a request
  `would_proxy_to`, and whether this pod holds the key's metadata/data locally
  (`meta_present_local`, `data_present_local`), plus the pod's `ring_members`.
  `curl` it against every pod for the same key: if they disagree on `owner`, the
  placement ring is inconsistent across pods (the miss cause); if they agree but the
  owner's `data_present_local` is false, it's data placement; if only
  `meta_present_local` lags, it's replication. Read-only and gated by the cluster
  secret (`X-Cluster-Secret`) when one is configured, since it is served on the
  public S3 port. On a healthy cluster every pod agrees on the owner, metadata is
  present everywhere, and data is present only on the owner.

## [4.4.32] - 2026-07-20
### Fixed
- **Cluster reads are no longer served by a node that holds no data** (issue #37).
  With `replica_count = 1` an object's data lives on exactly one node. Routing forced
  the candidate set to two nodes "for failover", so when a per-node failure detector
  marked the true owner down — including a false positive from a stale/unreachable
  probe address — a `GET`/`HEAD` could be answered by the second-ranked node (or
  handled locally) even though it holds no data, returning a phantom `Object not
  found` for a live object that then "reappeared" on a retry routed elsewhere. This
  is the read-after-write miss reported on a 12-node cluster that three prior
  read-path fixes (v4.4.25–v4.4.31) did not reach, because the miss happens in
  routing, before the consistent read runs. `ShouldProxy` now routes strictly within
  the actual data-holder set (the first `replica_count` nodes): a read is served
  locally only if this node holds the data, otherwise it is forwarded to the first
  healthy holder, and if every holder is marked down it is still forwarded to the
  primary owner rather than answered from an empty shard — so a falsely-down owner
  still serves the read, and a genuinely-down single copy returns an honest upstream
  error instead of a misleading 404. Legitimate failover with `replica_count >= 2`
  (where other nodes really do hold the data) is unchanged. Unit-covered; happy-path
  read-your-writes verified at 0 misses on a local multi-node cluster.

## [4.4.31] - 2026-07-20
### Added
- **Opt-in read-404 cause tracing for cluster reads** (`VAULTS3_TRACE_READS=1`), to
  diagnose the residual issue #37 read-after-write miss on a large cluster. When
  enabled, every `GET`/`HEAD` that returns `404` logs whether the cause is
  `meta_nil` (the object's Raft-replicated metadata hasn't arrived on this node — a
  replication/consistency lag the consistent read waits out) or `data_missing` (the
  metadata is present but this node has no data file — the read was served by a node
  that isn't the shard owner, a routing problem), plus which node proxied it here.
  On a local cluster (5 and 9 nodes, injected latency) the v4.4.29 read-your-writes
  path reproduces 0 misses, so this trace is aimed at capturing the actual cause on
  the reporter's 12-node topology. Off by default, zero overhead.

## [4.4.30] - 2026-07-20
### Added
- **Opt-in per-hop latency tracing for cluster reads** (`VAULTS3_TRACE_FORWARD=1`),
  to diagnose issue #38 (a large fixed GET time-to-first-byte in some clustered
  deployments). When enabled, every proxied request logs an `httptrace` breakdown of
  the upstream hop — DNS resolution time, TCP connect time, whether the keep-alive
  connection was reused, and upstream time-to-first-byte — so the ~fixed overhead can
  be attributed to the extra pod hop, a slow DNS lookup (e.g. Kubernetes `ndots`
  search expansion), a cold connection setup, or the owner's disk read. Off by
  default with zero overhead. The forward path itself measures ~2ms end-to-end
  (owner and forwarded reads alike) on a local multi-node cluster, so the fixed cost
  reported in #38 originates in the deployment environment, not the request path;
  this trace pinpoints where. Keep-alive to the owner is reused across requests once
  a response body is fully read.

## [4.4.29] - 2026-07-20
### Fixed
- **Cluster read-your-writes no longer depends on an inter-node RPC** (issue #37,
  thanks @kesavkolla). v4.4.27's read-side barrier asked the leader for its applied
  index over `/cluster/readindex` (derived via the same hardcoded-port address that
  was already wrong behind a split proxy in issue #29); when that call didn't reach
  the leader the barrier silently no-opped, so a `GET`/`HEAD` right after a `PUT`
  returned `Object not found` on a follower until replication caught up (~500ms).
  The consistent read now simply **polls the local store** until the just-written
  key replicates in through normal Raft (which reaches every node) or a 2s timeout
  elapses — no RPC, no derived addresses, so it is robust regardless of proxy or
  network topology. The leader (authoritative) never waits, the write path stays
  fast, and a genuine miss still returns `404` after the wait. Validated on a
  latency-injected multi-node cluster: 0 misses on tight sequential `PUT`→`GET` and
  on 5000 objects at `--concurrent=128`. For resilience to node/pod churn (when the
  placement ring is briefly reconciling), run `placement.replica_count: 2` so more
  than one node holds each object's data.

## [4.4.28] - 2026-07-20
### Fixed
- **`CreateBucket` on an existing bucket returns a clean `409 BucketAlreadyExists`.**
  In cluster mode the error message leaked the internal forwarding error
  (`cluster: leader rejected forwarded write (500): ...`), and any `CreateBucket`
  error was mapped to `BucketAlreadyExists` — so a genuine failure (e.g. an
  unreachable leader) would be misreported. The handler now checks existence first
  and returns a clean AWS-style message, treats only an "already exists" error as
  `409`, and surfaces other failures as `500 InternalError`.

## [4.4.27] - 2026-07-19
### Changed
- **Cluster read-your-writes reworked to a read-side barrier** (issue #37). v4.4.25
  made a follower block on its own FSM before acking every write; that added a
  replication round-trip to every write and collapsed throughput under high
  concurrency (a `warp` GET benchmark at `--concurrent=64` still saw `Object not
  found` and unstable writes). The barrier moved to the read path: writes are fast
  again (no per-write wait), and a GET/HEAD that misses on the owner catches up to
  the leader and re-checks before returning (`GetObjectMetaConsistent`), so a read
  right after a write still sees it. The barrier only fires on the rare read that
  races a write; a genuine miss still returns `404`. Bucket-existence checks
  already used this barrier-on-miss.

## [4.4.26] - 2026-07-19
### Security
- **The `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is no longer trusted by default** (issue #36
  hardening, thanks @arthurvmdantas). v4.4.22–24 auto-detected the reverse-proxy
  subpath from that client-supplied header when `base_path` was unset. That was not
  an auth bypass (SigV4 still requires the secret key; the dashboard value is
  sanitized and same-origin), but as defense-in-depth it is now opt-in: set
  `server.trust_forwarded_prefix: true` (env `VAULTS3_TRUST_FORWARDED_PREFIX`) to
  honor the header. By default only `server.base_path` is used, so a spoofed header
  can't influence the served base or signature verification. `base_path` always
  wins regardless of this flag.

## [4.4.25] - 2026-07-19
### Fixed
- **Cluster read-your-writes: `GET`/`HEAD` after a `PUT` no longer returns
  `Object not found`** (issue #37). Writes commit through Raft on the leader, but a
  follower served reads from local state that could lag the committed log, so a
  fast read-after-write on a follower missed the object. The node that handles a
  write now waits for its own state machine to apply the entry (the leader returns
  the committed index; the follower blocks on an FSM-tracked applied index) before
  acking, so a follow-up read — which routes to the same owner — sees it.
- **Cluster bucket visibility.** `BucketExists` now does a barrier-on-miss (catch
  up to the leader and re-check) so a write right after `CreateBucket` no longer
  spuriously gets `Bucket does not exist`. The barrier only costs a round-trip on
  a miss, never on a hit.
- **Placement ring reconciles to Raft membership every 1s** (was 3s), shrinking
  the window where two nodes disagree about a key's owner during membership churn.
- **A down / OOM-looping shard owner fails fast.** The cluster reverse proxy gained
  a short dial timeout + response-header timeout, so a request to an unreachable
  owner returns `502` quickly instead of hanging (large-object streaming after the
  headers is unaffected).
### Added
- **`replica_count ≥ 2` now replicates object data across nodes** (issue #37). With
  `placement.replica_count > 1`, a written object's data is streamed to the other
  nodes in its replica set, so a node loss no longer makes its objects
  unavailable — `GET` failover (which already tries replicas when the primary is
  down) now finds a copy. Replication is best-effort and asynchronous (it never
  blocks or fails the client write, and streams from the engine without buffering
  the whole object), so it provides eventual redundancy rather than synchronous
  write-quorum durability; pair it with erasure coding for disk-loss protection.
  `replica_count: 1` (default) is unchanged.
- Documented the cluster consistency model and per-pod memory sizing in
  upstream-docs/SCALING.md.

## [4.4.24] - 2026-07-19
### Fixed
- **S3 API works behind a reverse-proxy subpath** (issue #36 follow-up). With the
  dashboard hosted under a subpath (e.g. `/sistemas/s3-nac`), S3 requests returned
  `403 AccessDenied: signature mismatch`. SigV4 signs the request URI, so a client
  pointed at the proxied endpoint signs `/<base>/bucket/key`, but the proxy strips
  the prefix and VaultS3 verified the signature over the bare `/bucket/key`. The
  authenticator now reconstructs the signed path from `server.base_path` (or the
  proxy's `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header) before verifying, so signatures match. With
  no base path (default) verification is byte-for-byte unchanged, and a spoofed
  prefix can't bypass auth — it only changes the expected signature.

## [4.4.23] - 2026-07-18
### Fixed
- **Reverse-proxy subpath now works under the dashboard's CSP** (issue #36
  follow-up). v4.4.22 exposed the base path via an inline `<script>`, but the
  dashboard's own Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'`, no
  `script-src 'unsafe-inline'`) blocks inline scripts, so the SPA router never
  picked up the base and client-side routing broke behind a subpath (assets loaded
  fine). The base path is now published as a `<meta name="vaults3-base">` tag,
  which CSP does not restrict, and the frontend reads it from there.

## [4.4.22] - 2026-07-18
### Added
- **Host the dashboard under a reverse-proxy subpath** (issue #36). The dashboard
  hardcoded absolute `/dashboard/` and `/api/v1/` paths, so it couldn't be served
  behind a proxy at, say, `https://example.com/vaults3/dashboard/`. A new
  `server.base_path` (env `VAULTS3_BASE_PATH`, e.g. `/vaults3`) makes the server
  rewrite the served `index.html` — asset URLs and a runtime base the SPA reads
  for its router basename and API base — so everything resolves under the subpath.
  When `base_path` is unset the server also auto-detects the proxy's
  `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header (a forwarded prefix is sanitized to safe path
  characters). Default is empty, so a normal root deployment is unchanged.

## [4.4.21] - 2026-07-17
### Fixed
- **Dashboard file browser now shows folder dates** (issue #35 follow-up). v4.4.20
  made the API return a Last-Modified for folders, but the dashboard's file list
  still hardcoded `-` in the Modified column for folder rows, so the date never
  showed. The column now renders the folder's date (falling back to `-` only when
  genuinely absent). This works on existing buckets — the date is computed from
  the folder's contents at list time, so no re-migration is needed.

## [4.4.20] - 2026-07-16
### Changed
- **Folder listings now carry a Last-Modified date** (issue #35). S3 "folders"
  (common prefixes) have no timestamp in the standard, so listings returned them
  dateless and clients (e.g. rclone) filled in a fake date. VaultS3 already had
  the real date in hand while collapsing a folder — the folder's directory-marker
  object (its date preserved on migration) or, failing that, its first child — but
  discarded it. It now surfaces that date: `ListObjectsV2` adds a `<LastModified>`
  to each `<CommonPrefixes>` entry (a backward-compatible extension — standard S3
  clients ignore the extra element), and the dashboard file browser shows folder
  dates instead of blanks. Whether a given third-party client displays the folder
  date is up to that client.

## [4.4.19] - 2026-07-16
### Fixed
- **Deleted objects no longer linger as phantoms in a cluster** (issue #34). After
  a successful delete, a HEAD/GET from a client whose connection landed on a
  different node could still return the object — a HEAD came back `200` with null
  `Last-Modified`/`ETag` and a stale `Content-Length`. Two causes, both fixed:
  - **Metadata is now the single source of truth (correctness).** `HeadObject` and
    `GetObject` no longer fall back to "is there a data file on disk?" when an
    object's metadata is gone. A delete removes metadata cluster-wide (via Raft),
    so HEAD/GET now return `404 NoSuchKey` consistently on every node, even if a
    data file lingers.
  - **Orphan data files are now reaped (disk reclamation).** Writes land on a
    single node, but a past ring/primary change can leave an orphan copy on
    another node. A delete now broadcasts a best-effort, cluster-secret-authed
    object-delete to every node so the orphan's disk is reclaimed. Correctness
    does not depend on it — the metadata fix already prevents phantom reads.
  Single-node behavior is unchanged.

## [4.4.18] - 2026-07-15
### Fixed
- **Concurrent multipart uploads no longer fail with 404 `NoSuchUpload` in a
  cluster** (issue #32). In-progress multipart upload metadata was written through
  Raft, but reads were served from the local store. On a follower, a part uploaded
  immediately after `CreateMultipartUpload` could hit the node before it had
  applied its own forwarded create, so `UploadPart` returned `404 NoSuchUpload` —
  frequently under high concurrency (e.g. `rclone --transfers=600
  --s3-upload-concurrency 8`), never for sequential/low-concurrency uploads. Since
  every request for an object already routes to the same owner node and its part
  data is stored on that node's local disk, multipart metadata is now kept on the
  node-local store too (co-located, no replication lag). The final assembled
  object is still written through Raft so it is visible cluster-wide. Single-node
  behavior is unchanged.

## [4.4.17] - 2026-07-15
### Added
- **Cluster operations in `vaults3-cli` and the admin API** (issue #31). New
  `vaults3-cli cluster` subcommands — `status`, `join`, `leave`, `drain`,
  `undrain`, `rebalance`, `decommission` — backed by admin-authenticated
  `/api/v1/cluster/*` endpoints, so cluster membership no longer needs raw curl.
  - **Drain**: a node can be told to stop accepting writes (S3 object PUT/POST/
    DELETE return `503 SlowDown`) while continuing to serve reads, so it can be
    taken down for maintenance or evacuated. Drain a specific node by ID from any
    node (forwarded over the cluster channel) or the node you connect to.
  - **Rebalance**: trigger the background pass that moves objects to their correct
    hash-ring owner after membership changes.
  - **Decommission**: guided drain + rebalance for replacing a server (removal is
    left to an explicit `cluster leave` after you confirm data has moved).
  - Adding a member in Kubernetes is already automatic — scaling the StatefulSet
    replicas auto-joins the new pod; documented in upstream-docs/SCALING.md.

## [4.4.16] - 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- **Large multipart uploads no longer fail with `MalformedXML` on completion**
  (issue #26). The `CompleteMultipartUpload` request body was read through a 256KB
  limit, which silently truncated the part list for large objects (a 100GB upload
  is thousands of parts, and even ~17GB at the default 8MB part size exceeds it).
  The XML then failed to parse, so S3 clients (aws-cli, rclone, s3cmd) reported
  `MalformedXML: Could not parse request body` when finishing a multi-GB upload.
  The cap is raised to comfortably hold the full S3 maximum of 10,000 parts.

## [4.4.15] - 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- **Dashboard uploads now report storage failures instead of silently failing**
  (issue #26). A large upload that failed mid-write (for example a full data disk)
  was swallowed: the handler skipped the file, wrote no log, and still returned
  HTTP 200 with an empty result, so the browser showed a bare "upload failed" with
  nothing in the server logs. Each failed file is now logged with the real reason
  and returned to the client (the dashboard surfaces it, e.g. `write object: no
  space left on device`), and the request returns a 5xx when any file failed. Note
  for very large objects: a single browser POST holds the whole transfer with no
  resume, so an S3 client that does multipart upload (aws-cli, rclone, s3cmd) is
  the robust path for multi-GB files.

## [4.4.14] - 2026-07-10
### Fixed
- **Cluster capacity now gathers peer info over the cluster channel** (issue #29).
  The coordinator built the rollup by logging in to each peer's dashboard `/api/v1`
  API, which is unreachable peer-to-peer in split-`console_port` or proxied
  (Kubernetes + Envoy) deployments — every remote node showed as unreachable while
  only the node serving the request appeared. Nodes now expose their capacity on a
  new cluster-secret-authenticated `/cluster/sysinfo` endpoint (served next to
  `/cluster/status`), and the coordinator fetches it over the same peer addresses
  the placement proxy already uses for S3 forwarding — no dashboard login, no
  console-port dependency. Response is assembled server-side.

## [4.4.12] - 2026-07-10
### Fixed
- **Cluster capacity now reports *why* a node is unreachable** (issue #29). The
  rollup silently marked peers unreachable when the login to fetch their info
  failed (it did not check the login response status). Each unreachable node now
  carries an error reason (shown in the dashboard and `vaults3-cli info`), e.g. a
  peer HTTP 403 (its `peer_apis` address is not serving the dashboard API, often a
  split `console_port` or the S3 port) versus a connection refused. `vaults3-cli
  info`'s own login error is likewise clearer: a 403 means the endpoint is not
  serving `/api/v1`, and a 401 means the root admin key is required (not an IAM key).

## [4.4.11] - 2026-07-10
### Fixed
- **`vaults3-cli object ls` now lists past 1000 objects and shows a folder view**
  (issue #30). It was capped at a single 1000-key page (the continuation token was
  ignored) and always listed flat. It now follows the pagination cursor to list
  everything, and by default shows a `mc ls`-style view: immediate objects plus
  folders (`CommonPrefixes`), with `--recursive` for the full nested listing.

## [4.4.10] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Cluster-wide capacity overview.** `GET /api/v1/cluster/info` aggregates every
  node's version and on-disk capacity into a cluster total plus a per-node
  breakdown (unreachable nodes are marked, not fatal), the multi-node equivalent
  of `mc admin info`. The dashboard Stats capacity panel and `vaults3-cli info` now
  show the cluster totals and per-node rows when clustered, and fall back to the
  single-node view otherwise.

## [4.4.9] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Server and storage-capacity overview.** A new `GET /api/v1/system` endpoint
  reports the version, data directories, on-disk capacity (total / used / free,
  aggregated across the distinct filesystems backing the data, cold-tier, and
  erasure directories), and logical object usage. The dashboard Stats page shows a
  capacity bar, and `vaults3-cli info` prints the same overview. This is the
  single-node answer to "how much capacity is there and how much is occupied"
  (a lightweight equivalent of the capacity numbers `mc admin info` shows).

## [4.4.8] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- **Lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads** (issue #28). A bucket
  lifecycle rule can now expire abandoned multipart uploads (from killed or failed
  clients) after a number of days, via the standard S3
  `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` / `DaysAfterInitiation` element (works with
  `aws s3api`, `mc`, and boto3) and via a field in the dashboard lifecycle editor.
  A rule may now specify only this action, with no object expiration. The lifecycle
  worker that enforces it now also deletes the uploaded part files from disk, not
  just the upload metadata, so the space is actually reclaimed.

## [4.4.7] - 2026-07-09
### Fixed
- **Large-file migration no longer times out** (issue #26). The migration source
  client used a single total request timeout that also capped reading the response
  body, so any object that took longer than the timeout to download failed with
  "context deadline exceeded ... while reading body". The client now bounds only
  connect, TLS, and time-to-first-byte, letting a large object body (tens of GB)
  stream for as long as it needs.
- **Large-file dashboard uploads no longer fail, and folder uploads keep their
  structure** (issue #26). The upload handler buffered the entire request body to
  a temp file before writing to storage, which failed for very large files when
  the temp dir filled. It now streams each part straight to storage (no temp
  buffering, no double copy). It also preserves the relative folder path in the
  filename instead of flattening subfolders to the base name.

## [4.4.6] - 2026-07-08
### Fixed
- **Directory-marker objects (keys ending in `/`) no longer corrupt folders or
  break migration and s3fs.** Zero-byte "folder" objects created by s3fs, MinIO,
  and folder uploads were stored as regular files, which then blocked every child
  object under that prefix and failed with `mkdir ...: not a directory` (ENOTDIR).
  Such keys are now stored as real directories so children nest correctly, read
  back as empty objects, and delete cleanly. This affects all storage engines
  (plain, compressed, encrypted, per-bucket, KMS, erasure). Despite the report
  naming FreeBSD, the bug was OS-agnostic.

## [4.4.5] - 2026-07-07
### Added
- **Migration is now resumable and parallel** (issue #24). A migration that stops
  (restart or crash) no longer re-copies the whole bucket when restarted: objects
  already present at the destination with the same size are skipped, so it continues
  where it left off. Objects within a bucket are also copied with a bounded worker
  pool (configurable, default 8) instead of one at a time, so large buckets migrate
  much faster. The job now reports a `skipped` count alongside `copied`/`failed`.

## [4.4.4] - 2026-07-05
### Fixed
- **S3 clients that omit the space after commas in the SigV4 Authorization header
  now authenticate** (issue #22). The header parser split on `", "` only, so clients
  like WinSCP and S3 Browser, which send `Credential=...,SignedHeaders=...,Signature=...`
  without spaces, failed with "missing auth parameters" and a 403. The parser now
  accepts commas with or without surrounding whitespace, per the SigV4 spec.
- **Dashboard IAM actions no longer error with "The string did not match the expected
  pattern"** (issue #23). Attaching a policy to a user, adding a user to a group, and
  attaching a policy to a group returned HTTP 200 with an empty body, and the dashboard
  parsed that empty body as JSON (which throws on Safari/WebKit). Those actions now
  return 204 No Content, and the dashboard tolerates empty success bodies.

## [4.4.3] - 2026-07-05
### Added
- **Login page improvements.** A remember-me option, a show/hide toggle for the secret
  key, and a dark-mode toggle on the login screen. When remember-me is left unchecked
  the session token is now kept only for the tab session and cleared when the tab
  closes, instead of always persisting. Contributed by @idpcks in #21.

## [4.4.2] - 2026-07-05
### Added
- **File browser grid view.** The object browser has a new grid layout with file-type
  icons, toggleable with the existing list view from the toolbar. The choice is
  remembered per browser. Contributed by @idpcks in #20.
- **Collapsible dashboard sidebar.** The desktop sidebar can collapse to an icon rail
  to give the content area more room. Contributed by @idpcks in #20.

### Fixed
- **Dragging an empty folder onto the upload dropzone no longer hangs.** It now reports
  that no files were found instead of spinning. Contributed by @idpcks in #20.
- **Dark-mode theme toggle icon is visible again.** It used an invalid Tailwind size
  class (`w-4.5`) that rendered it at zero size. Contributed by @idpcks in #20.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-07-02
### Added
- **Migration source presets in the dashboard.** The Migrate wizard now has a source
  type dropdown (MinIO, SeaweedFS, Garage, Ceph, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi,
  Backblaze B2, or any S3-compatible) that pre-fills the endpoint hint and the SigV4
  region, most importantly Garage's non-default region. The migrator already read any
  S3-compatible source, so this is discoverability, not new migration logic. Verified
  live against a real SeaweedFS S3 gateway and a real Garage cluster.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-07-02

A correctness, WORM, and stability release from a real-world test pass (boto3
against the core S3 API, advanced features, and the compression/encryption/packing
engines) plus an audit of the high-risk packages. Every fix has a regression test.

### Security
- **Object lock (WORM) is now enforced on delete.** The non-versioned delete path
  never checked retention or legal hold, so an object under a COMPLIANCE,
  legal-hold, or non-bypassed GOVERNANCE lock could be permanently deleted. Deletes
  of locked objects are now refused (with governance bypass honored), on both the
  retention API and the inline `x-amz-object-lock-*` PUT headers.
- **SigV4 auth no longer buffers the whole request body in memory.** Signature
  building read the entire upload into RAM (even for `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`, where the
  hash was discarded), so any caller with a valid access key could exhaust memory
  and every large upload was buffered rather than streamed. The client signed
  content hash is now used directly and the body streams through.
- **Bucket quota can no longer be undercut via `X-Amz-Decoded-Content-Length`.** An
  aws-chunked client could declare a tiny size to pass admission and then stream a
  much larger object. Quota is re-checked against the real decoded size.

### Fixed
- **CompleteMultipartUpload could destroy an existing object.** On the default
  (non-encrypted) path, assembly wrote straight to the final object path and removed
  it on a missing part, truncating or deleting whatever was already stored there,
  non-atomically, and shadowing packed-engine objects. Completion now assembles into
  a temp file and writes through the engine, so it is atomic, wrapper-aware
  (compression, encryption, packing), and never touches the target until the new
  object is fully assembled.
- **Range (206) responses no longer carry a whole-object checksum header.** Modern
  SDKs (boto3 1.36+, aws-cli v2) validate `x-amz-checksum-*` against the bytes they
  receive, so a whole-object checksum made every range download fail. The header is
  now emitted only on full (200) responses.
- **S3 Select now returns a proper AWS event stream.** It previously wrote raw
  CSV/JSON, which no S3 SDK can parse (they fail on the event-stream prelude
  checksum). Results are now framed as Records, Stats, and End messages with CRCs,
  and `CAST(col AS TYPE)` in predicates is supported.
- **Object lock buckets now behave like AWS.** Creating a bucket with object lock
  enabled auto-enables versioning (required for object lock), inline lock headers are
  applied on every PutObject path, and `GetObjectLockConfiguration` reports the true
  state (404 when object lock is not configured) instead of always claiming Enabled.
- **Dashboard bucket size/count no longer drift.** Version promote and delete now
  adjust the cached counters by the correct delta, and the one-time backfill reads
  the metadata index atomically, which is correct for versioned, compressed, and
  encrypted buckets (an engine filesystem walk counted on-disk bytes and skipped
  versioned data).
- **Third-party-signed presigned URLs with spaces now verify.** The presigned
  canonical query used Go's `+` for spaces instead of RFC 3986 `%20`, so a URL signed
  by boto3/aws-cli whose query carried a space (for example a
  `response-content-disposition` filename) failed verification.
- **`x-amz-meta-*` metadata keys are returned lowercased**, matching AWS, rather than
  Title-Cased.
- **Cluster: a node no longer routes to a dead peer after a restart.** The reverse
  proxy cache was keyed by node ID and never invalidated when a node's address
  changed, so it kept forwarding to the old address forever. The cache entry is now
  dropped when the address changes or the node leaves.
- **Backups can no longer run twice concurrently.** The scheduler used a
  load-then-store check instead of a compare-and-swap, so two triggers (or a trigger
  racing the ticker) could both start and write the same target directory.
- **Small-file packing: reads no longer fail during a volume roll.** `readFrame`
  released the lock between capturing the active file handle and reading it, so a
  concurrent roll could close the handle mid-read. The read now holds the lock and
  falls back to opening the sealed volume by path.
- **In-flight upload temp files (`.vaults3-tmp-*`) are excluded** from object listing
  and bucket-size walks.

### Added
- **ListObjectsV2 delimiter support.** The V2 listing now honors `delimiter` and
  returns `CommonPrefixes`, so folder-style browsing works for aws-cli, SDK
  paginators, and the dashboard file browser. The grouping is done at the sorted
  metadata index so it stays O(page) for large prefixes.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-06-30
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: `aws-chunked` (streaming) uploads were stored corrupted.** Modern AWS
  SDKs (boto3/botocore 1.36+, aws-cli, aws-sdk-js v3) default to flexible checksums
  and, when the transport supports it, notably **HTTP/2, which Go negotiates for
  any TLS listener**, stream the body with `Content-Encoding: aws-chunked` and
  `x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-…-PAYLOAD`. VaultS3 didn't decode that framing,
  so the chunk-size headers + trailing checksum were written into the object itself
  (a 100-byte PUT stored as 142 bytes). Net effect: **uploads over HTTPS from recent
  SDKs were silently corrupted.** The request body is now de-chunked centrally
  before any handler reads it (covers PutObject, multipart UploadPart, POST). SigV4
  is unaffected (streaming modes sign the `STREAMING-…` literal, not the body).
  Verified over HTTPS with boto3 (0 B, 5 MB), aws-cli (incl. 60 MB multipart), and
  boto3 multipart, all byte-for-byte. HTTP path unchanged.
### Added
- **Separate port for the Dashboard vs the S3 API (issue #18).** Set
  `server.console_port` (e.g. `9001`) to serve the Web UI + its `/api/v1/` on a
  dedicated listener, leaving the S3 API on `server.port`, so each can have its
  own firewall rules, TLS, and reverse proxy (MinIO-style). Default `0` keeps
  everything on one port (unchanged). Env: `VAULTS3_CONSOLE_PORT` /
  `VAULTS3_CONSOLE_ADDRESS`.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-06-30
### Added
- **Per-bucket encryption keys (opt-in).** For bucket-per-tenant deployments, each
  bucket can now be encrypted with its own key that is **not shared** with other
  tenants, or opt out and stay plaintext. Enable with `encryption.per_bucket: true`
  (the configured `key` becomes a master KEK). A bucket provisions its own data key
  the first time it opts into SSE via `PUT /{bucket}?encryption`. Uses envelope
  encryption (KEK-wrapped per-bucket data keys, AES-256-GCM), supports key **rotation**
  and **crypto-shredding**, and keeps reading objects written before the switch via
  `encryption.legacy_key`. Managed from the dashboard's bucket page (enable / rotate /
  shred) and the `/api/v1/buckets/{b}/encryption` endpoints. See
  `upstream-docs/design/per-bucket-encryption.md`. Transparent to S3 clients. Opt-out buckets
  stay plaintext.
- **SSE-C (customer-provided encryption keys).** Operator-blind per-object encryption:
  clients pass `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-*` headers. The server
  encrypts/decrypts with the supplied key and stores only the key's MD5 (never the
  key). Wrong/missing key is rejected on GET/HEAD. (PUT/GET/HEAD on the non-versioned
  path.)
### Fixed
- **Multipart uploads now respect encryption.** `CompleteMultipartUpload` wrote the
  assembled object straight to disk, bypassing the encryption layer, so multipart
  (i.e. large) objects were stored **plaintext** even in encrypted buckets. The
  assembled object is now written through the engine, so per-bucket and SSE-S3/KMS
  encryption cover multipart objects too. (Non-encrypted deployments keep the fast
  direct path.)
- **Presigned URLs from standard S3 clients were rejected (`SignatureDoesNotMatch`).**
  The presigned-URL verifier encoded the canonical request path with a function
  that escaped `/` to `%2F`, while header-auth was already fixed (issue #9) to
  preserve slashes. Since every key path has slashes, presigned GET/PUT URLs from
  boto3 / aws-cli / the SDKs always failed. Now uses the per-segment path encoder,
  matching header auth, presigned GET/PUT verified end-to-end (incl. keys with
  `&`, `$`, spaces).
- **Object browser slow + capped on large buckets (issue #16 follow-up).** Two
  bugs in the dashboard file browser (`/api/v1/objects`):
  - *Backend:* for **non-versioned** buckets the listing fell back to a full
    `filepath.Walk` of the bucket **plus an MD5 hash of every file's contents** on
    every page request, so browsing a 500k-object bucket took minutes. It now
    reads the BoltDB metadata index (seek to page, O(pageSize)) like the S3 API
    already does, ~1.5ms per page regardless of bucket size.
  - *Frontend:* the browser fetched only the first page and ignored the
    `truncated`/continuation cursor, so only the first ~200 objects were ever
    visible. It now pulls 1,000 per request with a **Load more** control (server
    cursor `nextStartAfter`, folder roll-ups de-duplicated across pages), so the
    whole bucket is reachable.
  - *Folder-heavy buckets:* folders were rolled up **client-side** from a flat page,
    so a bucket with thousands of folders surfaced only a handful per page. Listing
    now collapses folders **server-side** (`ListLatestObjectsDelimited`) and seeks
    past each folder's contents, a folder level returns up to ~1,000 folders per
    page and is O(folders) instead of O(objects). Measured: a 5,000-folder bucket
    lists in 5 pages (~1.8ms/page) instead of hundreds.

## [4.2.22] - 2026-06-30
### Fixed
- **Slow dashboard pages with large buckets (issue #16).** The Home/Buckets/Stats/
  Cost pages computed storage + object count by walking the entire bucket on the
  filesystem (`BucketSize` → `filepath.Walk`) on **every** request, so cost scaled
  with object count, ~13s per page load at 1M objects (reproduced locally). They
  now read **maintained per-bucket counters** kept in the metadata store and
  updated incrementally on every write (put/overwrite/delete), so reads are O(1)
  regardless of object count. Existing data is backfilled with a single one-time
  walk on first load after upgrade, then never walked again. Measured: 12.8s →
  **0.4ms** at 1M objects, counts exact.

## [4.2.21] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Helm chart: Deployment mode + existing PVCs for backup/restore (issue #15).**
  A new `controller.kind` value selects `StatefulSet` (default) or `Deployment`
  (single-node), and `persistence.data.existingClaim` / `persistence.metadata.existingClaim`
  let you mount pre-created PVCs, e.g. claims restored from a Velero or k8up
  backup. Deployment-mode PVCs are annotated `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` so
  they survive uninstall. Verified end-to-end on kind: write data → uninstall
  (PVCs kept) → reinstall with `existingClaim` → data intact. Deployment mode is
  guarded to single-node (incompatible with `cluster.enabled`/multi-replica).
- **Helm chart auto-clustering (Beta, issue #12 follow-up).** With
  `cluster.enabled=true` and `replicaCount>=3`, the StatefulSet now auto-forms a
  Raft cluster, pod-0 bootstraps as the initial leader and the rest auto-join it,
  with no manual bootstrap/join steps. A pod that restarts with a new IP
  re-announces itself automatically (the Raft server ID is the stable pod name.
  the address is the current pod IP). New `VAULTS3_CLUSTER_ENABLED/BOOTSTRAP/
  JOIN_ADDR/PEERS` env overrides drive the per-pod config, and a node-initiated
  `AutoJoin` (retry + leader-redirect) makes pod start order irrelevant.
- **Cluster metadata is now replicated across nodes via Raft consensus (Beta).**
  The API and S3 handlers depend on a `metadata.StoreAPI` interface. When
  clustering is on, the server injects a `DistributedStore` that commits every
  metadata write (bucket/object/version/IAM/…, all 58 command types) through the
  Raft log, so all nodes converge. Writes are accepted on **any** node: a write
  landing on a follower is transparently forwarded to the leader (new
  `/cluster/apply` endpoint), so there is no "write only to the leader" rule.
  Reads stay local. The data-placement hash ring tracks **live Raft membership**
  (it previously only saw statically-configured peers, so auto-clustered nodes
  placed object data inconsistently). Object reads proxy to the owning node across
  the cluster. **Dashboard** uploads place each file on its hash owner and
  downloads/deletes proxy to the owner, so the web UI is consistent with the S3
  path. Inter-node endpoints (`/cluster/join` `/leave` `/apply`) are authenticated
  with a **shared cluster secret** (the chart reuses the admin secret key).
  Verified end-to-end on a 3-node kind cluster: bucket create/delete on the leader
  **and** on a follower (via forwarding) replicate to every node. An object PUT on
  one node is byte-for-byte readable from another. A dashboard upload on one node
  is downloadable from another. 60 concurrent writes across all nodes are visible
  with full integrity from every node. Killing the leader elects a new one and
  writes continue. The recovered node rejoins and catches up to data written while
  it was down. Unauthenticated inter-node calls are rejected.
  **Beta:** clustering is functional but newer/less battle-tested than single-node
  + erasure coding, validate against your workload before trusting it as the only
  copy of critical data.

## [4.2.20] - 2026-06-29
### Security
- **Rebuilt on the patched Go 1.26.3 toolchain and updated `golang.org/x/*`
  dependencies to clear standard-library and dependency CVEs in the published
  Docker image.** The image was being built with an outdated Go 1.25.x toolchain
  (a stale `golang:1.25-alpine` base served from the CI build cache), which
  `govulncheck` flagged for 14 reachable stdlib vulnerabilities plus 2 in
  `golang.org/x/net`. Bumped the builder to `golang:1.26-alpine`, the CI/release
  Go to 1.26, `go.mod` to `go 1.26.0` (`toolchain go1.26.3`), and
  `x/net`→v0.56.0 / `x/crypto`→v0.53.0 / `x/text`→v0.38.0 / `x/sys`→v0.46.0.
  Reachable vulnerabilities drop from 16 to 2 (the last two are fixed only in the
  not-yet-released Go 1.26.4 and will clear automatically on the next rebuild).
  No application code changed.

### Added
- **S3 migration now carries over bucket policies and tags (IAM/policies
  migration).** Previously migration copied only buckets and objects. The access
  policy and tag set on each source bucket were left behind. Migration now fetches
  the source bucket's policy (`GET /{bucket}?policy`) and tags
  (`GET /{bucket}?tagging`) and applies them locally, so access control survives
  the move. Best-effort and standard-S3, works against MinIO, AWS S3, Garage, or
  any S3-compatible source. A bucket with no policy/tags (404) is not an error.
  The migration job now reports a `policies` count, surfaced in the dashboard.
  User/access-key migration is intentionally out of scope (it relies on each
  vendor's proprietary admin API, not the portable S3 API).

## [4.2.19] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- **S3 migration now preserves each object's original metadata instead of
  stamping today's date (issue #13).** Migrated objects kept their content but were
  written with `LastModified = now`, so a migration looked like everything was
  created on migration day, breaking lifecycle rules, sort-by-date, and audit
  trails. Migration now carries over the source's original modified time, user
  metadata (`x-amz-meta-*`), and content headers (Content-Encoding/Disposition/
  Cache-Control/Language), and stamps the on-disk file mtime to match so every
  surface (dashboard, S3 `HEAD`/`GET`/`ListObjectsV2`) reflects the real date.
  Because VaultS3's migrator writes directly to its own store (not via PutObject),
  it can preserve the original date where `mc mirror --preserve` structurally
  cannot. Also fixed: the migrator now disables transparent response
  decompression, so gzip-encoded source objects are copied verbatim rather than
  silently decoded while keeping their `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.

## [4.2.18] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Kubernetes deployment (issue #12).** A Helm chart (`deploy/helm/vaults3/`) and
  a no-Helm plain-manifest quickstart (`deploy/k8s/quickstart.yaml`). Deploys
  VaultS3 as a StatefulSet with admin keys from a Secret, `vaults3.yaml` from a
  ConfigMap, persistent volumes for `/data` and `/metadata`, liveness/readiness
  probes on `/health` and `/ready`, a non-root securityContext, and opt-in Ingress
  and Prometheus ServiceMonitor. Validated with `helm lint` + `kubeconform` and
  deployed end-to-end on a live cluster (StatefulSet rollout, bound PVCs, probes,
  Secret-injected credentials, and data surviving a pod restart).

## [4.2.17] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- **Objects uploaded or deleted through the web dashboard were never replicated
  to peers (issues #10, #11).** Only writes via the S3 API enqueued
  replication events. The dashboard upload/delete handlers did not, so a user who
  added files through the UI saw `last synced: never` and zero objects on the
  target. The dashboard mutation paths (upload, single delete, bulk delete) now
  enqueue replication events through the same callback as the S3 API, for both
  push and active-active modes. Note: this also means the **target instance does
  not need replication enabled**, one-way push only requires replication on the
  source plus valid peer credentials on the target.

## [4.2.16] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- **Replication dashboard showed "No replication peers configured" despite peers
  being set in `vaults3.yaml` (issue #10).** The replication status endpoint built
  its peer list from status records instead of the configured peers, so a peer
  that hadn't replicated anything yet (no status record) was invisible, even
  though the worker had loaded it (`peers=N` in the log). It now lists the
  configured peers and enriches each with its live status, so a freshly-configured
  peer shows immediately (with zero activity until it syncs).

## [4.2.15] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Small-file packing (experimental, issue #7).** A new `packing` storage mode
  packs objects up to `max_object_size` into large append-only **volume** files, 
  each object an independent zstd frame, with byte-offset locations in a BoltDB
  index, to avoid the per-file overhead (inodes, syscalls, disk blocks) of
  millions of tiny objects. Larger objects fall through to individual files.
  Deleted/overwritten objects leave dead space that is reclaimed by background
  **compaction** (configurable interval) or on demand via `POST /api/v1/compact`.
  Crash-safe (frames fsync'd before the index commit) and concurrency-safe
  (compare-and-swap repointing, read-lock during volume deletion). Off by default.
  configured under `packing:` in vaults3.yaml. Not yet composable with encryption
  or erasure coding (skipped, with a warning, if either is enabled). This is the
  packing half of #7. The codec half (gzip→zstd) is below.

### Changed
- **Object compression now uses Zstandard (zstd) instead of gzip (issue #7).**
  New objects are written with zstd, better compression ratio and speed.
  Objects written by older gzip builds are still read transparently (the codec is
  detected by magic number), so there is no migration and nothing breaks. Data
  written while compression was off is passed through unchanged. The same 1GB
  decompressed-size cap (decompression-bomb protection) and excluded file types
  apply. (`klauspost/compress`, already in the dependency tree.)

## [4.2.12] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Sidebar version indicator (issue #8).** The dashboard sidebar now shows the
  running version (from `GET /api/v1/version`) with a subtle "update available"
  dot when a newer release exists, linking to the releases page, so it's obvious
  at a glance which version you're on.
- **Cancel a running migration (issue #8).** The Migrate page shows a Cancel
  button on in-progress jobs (`POST /api/v1/migrate/cancel`). Cancellation takes
  effect between objects, any in-flight object copy finishes first, so no
  partial objects are left behind, and the job ends in a `cancelled` state.
  Starting an identical migration (same source + buckets) while one is already
  running is now rejected, so accidental double-clicks no longer spawn parallel
  copies (the Migrate button also disables while that source is busy).

### Changed
- **Docker images and `make build` now embed the build version** (`-ldflags -X
  main.version`), so the sidebar version indicator and `-version` show the real
  release (e.g. `v4.2.12`) instead of `dev`. Previously only the GitHub Release
  binaries injected it, so Docker/source builds reported `dev`.

## [4.2.11] - 2026-06-28
### Fixed
- **Object keys with `&`, `$`, or spaces broke SigV4 auth (issue #9).** VaultS3
  built the SigV4 canonical URI from the raw request path, which leaves
  sub-delimiters like `&` and `$` literal, but standard S3 clients (boto3,
  aws-cli, the AWS SDKs) percent-encode them strictly (`&`→`%26`, `$`→`%24`,
  space→`%20`, …). The signatures therefore didn't match → `SignatureDoesNotMatch`
  / `AccessDenied` for any key with special characters. This affected both
  directions and is now fixed everywhere the canonical URI is computed:
  - **Server** (`internal/s3` auth), now validates with strict per-segment
    encoding, so standard S3 clients can read/write special-character keys.
  - **Migrate source client** (`internal/migrate`), signs strictly, so
    migrating such keys from external S3 (the reported case) succeeds.
  - **Replication, FUSE, and CLI** clients, sign strictly too, so they keep
    working against the now-strict server.
  Keys without special characters are unaffected (strict == raw for them).
  Verified end-to-end live (boto3 PUT + cross-instance migration of a key with
  `&`, `$`, and spaces) plus regression tests on both the client and server sides.

## [4.2.10] - 2026-06-28
### Fixed
- **`ListObjectsV2` pagination was broken (no continuation token).** The handler
  set `IsTruncated` but never emitted a `NextContinuationToken`, and ignored an
  incoming `continuation-token`, so S3 clients (boto3, the AWS SDKs) could not
  page past the first response and never saw more than `max-keys` objects. The
  V2 handler now reads `continuation-token` and returns `NextContinuationToken`
  (an opaque cursor), so standard continuation-token pagination works to any
  depth. Verified end-to-end with boto3 across multi-page listings. (V1
  marker-based pagination already worked.)

### Changed
- **Listing now scales to very large buckets (millions of objects under one
  prefix).** `ListObjectsV2`/`V1` previously read the entire prefix range into
  memory and sorted it on every page, `O(n)` per page, which falls over at high
  object counts. Listing now seeks straight to the continuation marker in the
  sorted BoltDB index and reads only one page forward (`O(log n + page_size)`),
  with memory bounded by the page size. Page latency is flat (~0.7 ms for a
  1000-key page), measured (not extrapolated) from 1,000 to 100,000,000 objects
  in a single prefix. All listing (versioned and non-versioned) now goes through
  this metadata index instead of an `O(n)` filesystem walk. See
  `upstream-docs/SCALING.md` §11.

## [4.2.9] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Bucket snapshots ("git-for-buckets")**: a new `internal/snapshot` package plus
  a dashboard panel on each bucket: capture the bucket's state (commit), diff it
  against the live bucket, and roll back (restore) in one click, git-style history
  built on object versioning, with no external stack (vs. lakeFS, which needs a
  separate server + database). Restore re-points version pointers (no data
  deleted), so it resurrects deleted objects and is itself reversible. API under
  `/api/v1/buckets/{bucket}/snapshots`. Requires bucket versioning.

### Fixed
- The dashboard is now **version-aware** for object operations on versioned
  buckets: uploads create versions, downloads/zips resolve the latest version,
  and deletes write a delete marker (recoverable) instead of failing. Previously
  these used the unversioned path and broke on versioned buckets.

## [4.2.8] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Cost estimator**: a dashboard "Cost" page (and `GET /api/v1/tco`) that
  estimates the monthly/yearly cost of your live stored data on AWS S3, Google
  Cloud Storage, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and Wasabi (storage + adjustable
  egress) against self-hosting with VaultS3 (egress-free, $0). Pricing rates come
  from the server. The egress slider recomputes instantly client-side.
### Changed
- **Migration is now streaming + resilient (issue #6).** The migrator streams each
  object straight from the source into the local engine instead of buffering the
  whole body in memory (no more OOM risk on large objects), and retries transient
  source failures (HTTP 5xx / 429 / network errors) with exponential backoff, 
  while leaving permanent errors (4xx) to fail fast. Listing is retried too.

## [4.2.7] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Auto-update (opt-in)**: a new `internal/selfupdate` package checks GitHub
  Releases on a daily interval and surfaces a **dashboard banner** when a newer
  version is out (`GET /api/v1/version`). With `auto_update.apply: true` it also
  downloads the release for the running platform, **verifies its SHA-256 checksum**
  (refuses to install otherwise), atomically swaps the binary, and re-execs into
  the new version, never crossing a major version automatically. Updates only
  ever replace the binary. Object data, metadata, and config are untouched. Skips
  self-apply inside Docker (use Watchtower, documented in the README). Configure
  under `auto_update:` in vaults3.yaml (disabled by default).

## [4.2.6] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Migrate from S3 (`internal/migrate`)**: import buckets and objects from any
  S3-compatible source (MinIO, AWS S3, Garage…) into VaultS3. A SigV4 source
  client (no AWS SDK) plus an async migrator with per-job progress, exposed via
  `POST /api/v1/migrate/test`, `POST /api/v1/migrate`, `GET /api/v1/migrate/jobs`
  and a dashboard wizard (Migrate page: connect → select buckets → live progress).
- **Dashboard semantic search**: the Search page now has a Keyword / Semantic
  toggle. Semantic mode queries the vector store and shows results ranked by
  cosine similarity (greys out with a hint when vector search is disabled).
- Settings page surfaces the Vector Search, Erasure Coding, and Clustering
  feature flags in its read-only status panel.

## [4.2.5] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Semantic / vector search (optional add-on)**: a new `internal/vector` package
  brings RAG-style retrieval into the single binary, with no external vector
  database. A dependency-free cosine-kNN index (persisted across restarts) is fed
  by any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (OpenAI, Ollama, llama.cpp,
  LM Studio, vLLM…), so users pick their own (often local, private) embedding
  model. Text objects are auto-embedded on upload (best-effort, off the request
  path). Query via `POST /api/v1/vectors/query`, status via
  `GET /api/v1/vectors/status`. Configure under `vector:` in vaults3.yaml
  (disabled by default).

### Fixed
- **Conditional writes are now atomic.** `If-Match` / `If-None-Match` on PutObject
  previously checked the precondition and wrote in separate steps (a TOCTOU race):
  concurrent `If-None-Match: *` creates to the same key could all succeed,
  breaking the compare-and-swap guarantee that makes conditional writes usable for
  lock files and Iceberg-style commits. Writes carrying a conditional header now
  hold a per-key striped lock across the check-and-write, so exactly one create
  wins. Regression test spins up 16 concurrent creators and asserts 1×200 + 15×412.

## [4.2.4] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- Fault-injection / consensus test coverage for the data-durability subsystems
  that previously had little or none, and the last seven untested packages, so
  **every `internal/` package now has tests**:
  - **erasure**: Reed-Solomon encode/reconstruct, lost-disk reads, and the
    background healer repairing degraded objects (0% → ~64%).
  - **cluster**: consistent-hash ring + failure-detector state machine, plus a
    real multi-node **Raft consensus** harness (in-memory transport): leader
    election, log replication, no-split-brain under network partition, and
    membership changes (14.9% → 22.5%).
  - **replication**: vector-clock causality/merge and all three conflict
    resolution strategies (last-writer-wins, largest-object, site-preference).
  - **tiering** (0% → ~39%), **backup** (0% → ~48%), **fuse** (0% → ~45%).
  - **metrics, lambda, batch, inventory, scanner, accesslog, dashboard**: baseline
    coverage for the remaining packages.
- `upstream-docs/BENCHMARKS.md`, reproducible benchmark methodology (the `/speedtest`
  endpoint, `warp` for comparative throughput, RSS measurement) + results template.
- README **Production Readiness** section (stable vs. beta paths) and a
  refreshed competitor comparison verified against June 2026 sources.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and GitHub issue/PR templates.

### Fixed
- **Tiering deadlock (data-availability bug):** the background tier scan called
  `SetObjectTier` (a write transaction) from inside `IterateAllObjects` (a read
  transaction), which deadlocks BoltDB, the scan would hang forever the first
  time it tried to migrate any object to cold. `scan()` now collects candidates
  inside the read txn and migrates them after it closes. Found by the new
  tiering tests.

### Changed
- `internal/cluster`: extracted a `newNodeWithDeps` seam so the Raft transport
  and stores are injectable (enables the in-process consensus tests). The
  production `NewNode` path is unchanged (TCP transport + BoltDB).
- Competitor comparison table corrected: SeaweedFS now has a web admin UI and a
  working FUSE mount. MinIO's Community console was removed (2025) and the
  open-source repo archived (Feb 2026). Added an "as of June 2026" qualifier.
- Stopped tracking build artifacts and logs in git (`vaults3-cli`,
  `bin/vaults3-cli`, `access.log`, `test-results/`). Added `*.log` and
  `test-results/` to `.gitignore`.

## [4.2.3] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `upstream-docs/SCALING.md` operations guide: multi-disk erasure coding, multi-node
  Raft cluster setup, and lost-disk / lost-server / quorum-loss runbooks.
### Fixed
- `POST /api/v1/heal` was a stub that only acked the request. It now invokes the
  erasure healer (`Healer.Heal(bucket, prefix)`) asynchronously. (issue #5)

## [4.2.2] - 2026-06-16
### Security
- Removed esbuild from the dependency tree (Dependabot #16, GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr)
  by upgrading `vite` 6→8 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` 4→6. Vite 8 uses the
  Rolldown bundler instead of esbuild.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-06-06
### Security
- Bumped `react-router-dom` 7.13.0 → 7.17.0, clearing 6 Dependabot alerts
  (turbo-stream RCE, RSC/Location XSS, manifest/single-fetch DoS, open redirect).

## [4.2.0] - 2026-05-31
### Security
- Bumped `postcss` 8.5.6 → 8.5.15 (Dependabot, dev dependency).

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-02
### Fixed
- Four dashboard bugs: bucket stats drift, empty file browser listing, search
  result timestamps showing 1970, and a `/dashboard/buckets/` redirect loop.
- Versioned `ListObjectsV2`/`V1` returning empty results for versioned buckets.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- "Change Admin Credentials" feature in the dashboard Settings page.
- Distributed/enterprise features: erasure coding, Raft clustering,
  active-active replication, tiering, and backup.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- SSE-KMS encryption, AMQP/PostgreSQL event notifications, and Parquet support
  for S3 Select.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- Expanded S3 API surface and dashboard features.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-25
### Added
- First public release: S3-compatible object storage server with built-in web
  dashboard, CLI, versioning, WORM, notifications, full-text search, FUSE mount,
  and multi-platform release binaries + Docker images.
