# Contributing to VaultS3

Thanks for your interest in improving VaultS3! This guide covers how to build,
test, and submit changes.

## Getting started

VaultS3 is a Go server with a React (Vite) dashboard, shipped as a single binary.

**Prerequisites**

- Go **1.25+**
- Node.js **20.19+** (the dashboard builds with Vite 8 / Rolldown)
- `make`

**Build**

```bash
make build      # builds the React dashboard, then the server + CLI binaries
./vaults3       # starts the server on :9000 (dashboard at /dashboard/)
make cli        # build just the CLI (./vaults3-cli)
```

## Project layout

```
internal/
  s3/           S3 API handlers (PutObject, ListObjectsV2, multipart, …)
  api/          Dashboard REST API
  storage/      On-disk object engine
  versioning/   Object versioning, delete markers
  erasure/      Reed-Solomon erasure coding + background healer
  cluster/      Raft metadata, consistent-hash ring, failure detector
  replication/  Active-active (vector clocks) + one-way push
  iam/          Access keys, policies, OIDC, external authz webhook
  ...
web/            React dashboard (Vite)
upstream-docs/           Operator docs (see upstream-docs/SCALING.md)
```

## Running tests

```bash
go test ./...                       # all Go unit tests
go test ./internal/erasure/ -v      # a single package
go test -race ./internal/cluster/   # with the race detector
```

The dashboard:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build
```

Please add tests for any behavior change. The data-durability subsystems
(`erasure`, `cluster`, `replication`) are held to a higher bar, new logic there
should come with fault-injection coverage (corrupt a shard and heal, lose a
node, partition two sites and check convergence). See the existing
`*_test.go` files in those packages for the pattern.

## Translating the dashboard

The dashboard ships English, German, French, Russian and Simplified Chinese.
Adding a language is one JSON file, no code:

1. Copy `web/src/i18n/locales/en.json` to `web/src/i18n/locales/<code>.json`,
   where `<code>` is a BCP 47 tag (`es`, `pt-BR`, `ja`).
2. Translate the values. Leave the keys alone, and keep every `{placeholder}`
   exactly as it appears in English, since those are filled in at runtime.
3. Register it in `web/src/i18n/index.tsx`: import the file and add one entry to
   `LOCALES`. Write the label in the language itself (`Espanol`, not `Spanish`),
   so it is readable no matter which language the UI is currently in.
4. `cd web && npx vitest run` checks that your file has every English key, no
   keys English does not define, and the same placeholders in each string.

A key you leave out falls back to English at runtime, so a partial translation
never breaks the UI. Translations for the languages we already ship were drafted
without a native-speaker review, so corrections are genuinely welcome, please
send them as a PR.

Server-side messages (S3 API errors, log lines) are English only and are not
part of this.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork and create a feature branch off `main`.
2. Keep changes focused. One logical change per PR.
3. Run `go test ./...`, `npm run build`, and (for dashboard changes) `cd web && npx vitest run` before opening the PR.
4. Use clear, present-tense commit messages (e.g. `Fix versioned ListObjectsV2 empty result`).
5. Update `README.md` and any relevant docs when you change user-facing behavior.
6. Open the PR against `main` and describe **what** changed and **why**.
