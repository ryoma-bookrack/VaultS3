## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them privately via one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**, [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/Kodiqa-Solutions/VaultS3/security/advisories/new) (preferred)
2. **Email**, Send details to the repository owner

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within **48 hours**
- Status update within **7 days**
- Fix timeline depends on severity:
  - **Critical** (RCE, auth bypass, data leak): patch within 72 hours
  - **High** (privilege escalation, injection): patch within 1 week
  - **Medium/Low**: patch in next release

### Scope

The following are in scope:
- S3 API authentication bypass
- Encryption key exposure
- Path traversal / unauthorized file access
- JWT token vulnerabilities
- SQL/command injection
- Dashboard XSS or CSRF
- CORS misconfiguration allowing data theft
- Rate limiting bypass
- Raft cluster membership manipulation
- Replication sync endpoint abuse
- Inter-node proxy loop exploitation
- External authorization webhook abuse (response spoofing, or a decision cache poisoned across identities)
- KMS key exposure or unauthorized key access
- PROXY protocol spoofing (forged client IP)
- Bandwidth throttler bypass

### Out of Scope

- Denial of service (single-binary, expected to run behind a proxy in production)
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies (report upstream)
- Issues requiring physical access to the server

## Security Features

VaultS3 includes multiple security layers:

- **S3 Signature V4** authentication with full signature verification (including presigned URLs)
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption at rest
- **JWT-based** dashboard authentication (24h tokens, admin key masked in responses)
- **Constant-time credential comparison** (`crypto/hmac.Equal` prevents timing attacks on login)
- **IAM policies** with default-deny evaluation
- **Security headers** (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- **CORS origin validation** (same-origin + localhost only)
- **API rate limiting** (token bucket per RemoteAddr IP, not spoofable via X-Forwarded-For)
- **Input validation** (DNS-compatible bucket names, object key length/null byte/path traversal checks, enforced on all S3, API, and versioning endpoints)
- **Path traversal prevention** (rejects `..` segments in object keys at S3 handler, API, versioning API, CopyObject/UploadPartCopy source, and filesystem layers)
- **SSRF protection** (webhook, notification, and lambda function URLs validated against localhost, private IPs, link-local, and cloud metadata endpoints)
- **Upload size limits** (5GB per PUT object, 5GB per multipart part, enforced via `http.MaxBytesReader`)
- **IP allowlist/blocklist** (global and per-user CIDR)
- **Audit trail** with auto-pruning
- **Object locking (WORM)** for compliance
- **STS temporary credentials** with auto-expiry
- **Content-Disposition sanitization** (filenames escaped to prevent header injection)
- **Non-root Docker container** (runs as `vaults3` user, UID 1000)
- **Default credential warning** (startup log warning when using default admin credentials)
- **Error message sanitization** (OIDC and health check errors return generic messages, no internal detail leaking)
- **Raft consensus** (cluster writes require majority quorum, preventing split-brain)
- **Proxy loop prevention** (`X-VaultS3-Proxy` header prevents infinite request forwarding between cluster nodes)
- **Replication SSRF protection** (peer URLs validated against localhost, private IPs, link-local, and cloud metadata endpoints)
- **Replication peer authentication** (bidirectional sync uses SigV4-signed requests, peer access keys registered at startup)
- **Rebalance isolation** (`X-VaultS3-Rebalance` header marks internal object transfers)
- **External authorization webhook** (per-request decision delegated to an operator-configured HTTP endpoint, deny-only by default so it cannot widen IAM, fail-closed by default, explicit IAM Deny always wins, admin exempt, bounded response read, decision cache)
- **KMS envelope encryption** (HashiCorp Vault and local key provider, data encryption keys wrapped by master key, key rotation support)
- **Auto-TLS** (automatic Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning via ACME, self-signed fallback for development)
- **PROXY protocol v1** (extract real client IP from PROXY protocol header, validated format parsing)
- **Governance bypass protection** (`x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` header restricted to principals with `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission)
- **IAM policy conditions** (`StringEquals`, `StringLike`, `IpAddress`, `DateLessThan` condition operators evaluated per-request)
- **Bucket bandwidth throttling** (per-bucket upload/download rate limits prevent single-tenant resource monopolization)
- **POST policy validation** (HTML form upload policies validated for expiration, content-length-range, key conditions, and SigV4 signature)
- **Content-MD5 validation** (server-side MD5 integrity check on PUT rejects corrupted or tampered uploads)
- **S3 Checksum API** (CRC32, CRC32C, SHA1, SHA256 checksums verified on upload, returned on download for end-to-end integrity)
- **Conditional request handling** (`If-Match`/`If-None-Match` ETag preconditions prevent lost updates with 412 Precondition Failed)

## External Security Assessment

VaultS3 was reviewed in August 2026 by an external white-box security assessment
covering the S3 API, the console API, the authentication and authorization model,
the cluster and replication endpoints, and the dependency graph. It reported 14
findings, several of them remotely exploitable against a deployment running the
shipped defaults.

**All 14 are fixed in 4.4.56.** The [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) describes each one,
and the release notes carry the upgrade steps. If you run an earlier version,
upgrade, and read the
[upgrade notes](upstream-docs/UPGRADING.md#upgrading-to-4456-security-release): a few of the fixes
tighten authorization and change behaviour.

Two of them need action beyond upgrading. Rotate your administrator credentials
if this installation ever ran with the secret this project used to ship, since
persisted credentials survive an upgrade. And set `cluster.secret` before
upgrading a clustered deployment, because a clustered node now refuses to start
without one.

## Deployment Best Practices

- **Always change default credentials**: set `VAULTS3_ACCESS_KEY` and `VAULTS3_SECRET_KEY` environment variables
- **Use HTTPS in production**: set `VAULTS3_TLS_CERT` and `VAULTS3_TLS_KEY`, or run behind a reverse proxy with TLS termination
- **Run behind a reverse proxy** (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) for additional rate limiting, IP filtering, and access logging
- **Enable encryption at rest**: set `VAULTS3_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with a random 64-char hex key (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
- **Restrict network access**: use firewall rules to limit who can reach port 9000 (and Raft port 9001 in cluster mode)
- **Isolate Raft traffic**: bind the Raft port to a private network interface, never expose it publicly
- **Secure replication peers**: use unique access keys per peer, rotate credentials regularly
- **Monitor the audit trail**: review `/api/v1/audit` for suspicious activity
- **Monitor cluster health**: check `/cluster/status` and `/health` endpoints for node failures
- **Keep VaultS3 updated**: pull the latest Docker image regularly
- **Secure KMS configuration**: use HashiCorp Vault with AppRole or token auth. Rotate master keys periodically. Restrict Vault policy to minimum required paths
- **Enable Auto-TLS in production**: configure Let's Encrypt with a valid domain. Set `auto_tls.email` for certificate expiry notifications
- **Separate inter-node traffic**: bind cluster and replication traffic to a dedicated private network interface using `cluster.bind_addr`
- **Set bucket bandwidth limits**: configure per-bucket upload/download rate limits to prevent resource monopolization by a single tenant
