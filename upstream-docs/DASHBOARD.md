The built-in dashboard is available at `http://localhost:9000/dashboard/`. Login with your admin credentials. Features:

- Bucket browser, list, create, delete buckets
- Bucket detail, view/edit policies and quotas
- File browser, list, upload (drag & drop files and folders), download, delete objects with folder navigation, multi-select with bulk delete and bulk zip download, copy-to-clipboard for S3 URIs and keys, and a filter box that narrows the current folder to its direct children
- Access key management, create, list, revoke S3 API keys
- IAM management, users, groups, policies CRUD with attach/detach operations
- Audit trail, filter by user, bucket, time range with auto-refresh
- Search, full-text search across all buckets by key, content type and tags. See the query syntax below
- Notifications, view webhook notification configurations
- Replication, peer status cards, pending queue table
- Lambda triggers, status overview, trigger table with event filtering
- Backups, status cards, history table, manual trigger button
- Activity log, real-time S3 operation feed with auto-refresh
- Storage stats, logical size, VaultS3's measured on-disk footprint and total filesystem usage side by side (with a per-directory and per-node breakdown), per-bucket breakdown, runtime metrics, auto-refresh toggle (30s)
- Migrate, import buckets from any S3-compatible source with live progress and a Cancel button for in-flight jobs
- Version indicator, the running version is shown at the bottom of the sidebar, with an "update available" hint linking to releases
- Dark/light theme, toggle with system preference detection
- Language, English, German, French, Russian, Simplified Chinese, detected from the browser and switchable in the top bar
- Responsive layout, mobile-friendly with collapsible sidebar
- JWT-based authentication (24h tokens)

The dashboard is embedded into the binary, no separate web server needed.

### Search syntax

Plain words are matched, lower-cased, against the bucket, key, content type and
tags, and every term has to match. Three prefixes narrow a search further:

| Filter | Matches |
|---|---|
| `type:image` | content type contains `image` |
| `tag:env=prod` | a tag with that key and value, key is case-insensitive |
| `etag:d41d8c` | ETag starting with those characters, quotes and case ignored |

A prefix with nothing after it, such as a bare `type:`, is treated as an empty
query rather than matching everything.

ETags are deliberately not searched by plain words. Any four hex characters
appear in roughly one MD5 in 2,000, so a short term like `4435` used to return
dozens of unrelated objects. Use `etag:` when you want to look one up.

**Whole-bucket search versus the folder filter.** The Search page uses an
in-memory index capped by `memory.max_search_entries` (50,000 by default), so on
a larger installation it covers only part of your objects and the server warns at
startup when that happens. The filter box on the Files page walks the store
instead, so within the folder you are in it is always complete.

### Language

The dashboard picks a language from the browser on first load and falls back to
English. Change it with the selector in the top bar, and the choice is stored per
browser, so different people using the same server can each read it in their own
language. There is no server-side setting.

Shipping today: **English, Deutsch, Français, Русский, and simplified Chinese**.
Russian was contributed by [@sweet0dream](https://github.com/sweet0dream). The
German, French and Chinese files were drafted without a native-speaker review, so
corrections are welcome.

**Adding a language takes one JSON file and no code**: copy
`web/src/i18n/locales/en.json`, translate the values, and add one entry to
`LOCALES` in `web/src/i18n/index.tsx`. Any key you leave out falls back to
English, so a partial translation is fine to send. See
[Translating the dashboard](../CONTRIBUTING.md#translating-the-dashboard) for the
full steps and the test that checks a locale file.

Server-side output (S3 API error codes, log lines) is English only.
