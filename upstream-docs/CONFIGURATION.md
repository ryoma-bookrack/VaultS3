## Write a config file

`vaults3 setup` asks a handful of questions, creates the directories, and writes
a config containing only what you chose:

```bash
./vaults3 setup                  # interactive
./vaults3 setup --non-interactive --data-dir ./data --default-bucket local
./vaults3 -config vaults3.yaml   # then start with it
```

It writes the file `0600` because it holds the admin secret, and refuses to
overwrite an existing config unless you pass `--force`.

## TLS

Enable HTTPS by providing cert and key files:

```yaml
server:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    cert_file: "/path/to/cert.pem"
    key_file: "/path/to/key.pem"
```


## Encryption at Rest

VaultS3 has three encryption modes. **Pick one.** They are server-wide settings
and they do not combine: whichever is configured decides how every object on the
server is sealed. A bucket cannot ask for a mode the server is not running.


**SSE-S3 (Static Key)**, Simple setup with a hex-encoded 32-byte key:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: true
  key: ""  # 64-char hex string: openssl rand -hex 32
```

**SSE-KMS (Key Management Service)**, Per-object encryption with KMS-managed data encryption keys:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: true
  kms:
    enabled: true
    provider: "vault"          # "vault" (HashiCorp Vault) or "local" (fallback)
    vault_addr: "http://vault:8200"
    vault_token: "hvs.xxx"
    key_name: "vaults3-dek"    # Transit engine key name
    local_key: ""              # hex-encoded fallback key (when provider: "local")
```

SSE-KMS fetches data encryption keys from HashiCorp Vault's Transit engine, caches them in memory, and supports key rotation. It needs no `key` of its own, the keys come from the KMS.

**Per-bucket keys**, each bucket sealed with its own data key, wrapped by a master key, so a bucket can be rotated or crypto-shredded on its own:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: true
  key: ""          # 64-char hex master key that wraps each bucket's data key
  per_bucket: true
```

In this mode a bucket stores plaintext until it opts in, with
`PutBucketEncryption` and `SSEAlgorithm: AES256`. That is the only algorithm this
mode can honour, and asking for `aws:kms` here is refused rather than accepted
and ignored. To use SSE-KMS instead, configure `encryption.kms` above and leave
`per_bucket` off. See [the design note](design/per-bucket-encryption.md).

**How objects are sealed.** From 4.4.53 an object is encrypted in 1 MiB chunks, each its own AES-256-GCM message with a nonce derived from a per-object random prefix, the chunk's index, and a flag marking the last chunk. That binding is what makes chunks impossible to reorder or move between objects and makes a truncated object fail to read rather than come back short. Each chunk is authenticated before any of its bytes are served, so a client never receives unverified plaintext.

The practical effect is on memory: a read costs one chunk, not one copy of the object. Before 4.4.53 an object was a single GCM message, which cannot be verified incrementally, so every concurrent reader of a large object held all of it (issue #49). Objects written by earlier versions keep the old format and are still read. Rewriting one migrates it. Reading an old-format object still costs about its own size, so rewrite large ones if pod memory is tight.

## Virtual-Hosted Style URLs

Set `server.domain` to enable virtual-hosted style access:

```yaml
server:
  domain: "s3.example.com"
```

This enables `bucket-name.s3.example.com/key` in addition to the default `s3.example.com/bucket-name/key` path-style.


## Health Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health   # liveness: {"status":"ok","uptime":"5h23m"}
curl http://localhost:9000/ready    # readiness: checks BoltDB, returns 503 if unhealthy
```


## Prometheus Metrics

Access metrics at `GET /metrics`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/metrics
```

Exposes: request counts by method, bytes in/out, per-bucket storage size and object counts, per-bucket request/bytes/error counters, quota usage, Go runtime stats (goroutines, memory, GC).

Storage is reported both ways, which is what makes growth diagnosable:

| Series | Measures |
|--------|----------|
| `vaults3_storage_size_bytes_total` | **Logical**: each object's current version, counted once. |
| `vaults3_disk_usage_bytes{dir="..."}` | **Physical**: what that directory actually occupies on disk, per data / metadata / erasure / cold-tier / Raft directory. Includes replicas, parity shards and non-current versions. |
| `vaults3_disk_usage_files{dir="..."}` | File count behind the figure above. |
| `vaults3_disk_usage_bytes_total` | Physical total for this node. |
| `vaults3_disk_usage_scanned_timestamp_seconds` | When the footprint was last measured, so a stale reading is detectable. |

Graphing physical against logical shows amplification directly. The `vaults3_disk_usage_*` series come from a cached background walk and are absent when `storage.usage_scan_interval_secs` is `0`.


## Per-Bucket Prometheus Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint includes per-bucket counters (limited to top 100 buckets):

```
vaults3_bucket_requests_total{bucket="my-bucket",method="PUT"} 42
vaults3_bucket_requests_total{bucket="my-bucket",method="GET"} 156
vaults3_bucket_bytes_in_total{bucket="my-bucket"} 10485760
vaults3_bucket_bytes_out_total{bucket="my-bucket"} 52428800
vaults3_bucket_errors_total{bucket="my-bucket"} 3
```

These complement the existing global metrics and per-bucket storage metrics, enabling monitoring and alerting per bucket.

## External Authorization

Delegate each access decision to an HTTP endpoint you run. Off by default:

```yaml
external_auth:
  enabled: false
  url: ""                # POST target, http or https
  timeout_ms: 2000
  cache_ttl_secs: 10     # 0 is 9x slower, see the guide before changing
  authoritative: false   # deny-only: narrows IAM, never widens it
  fail_open: false       # unreachable endpoint DENIES
  token: ""              # sent as "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

VaultS3 POSTs `{"accessKey","user","action","resource","sourceIP"}` and expects a
200 carrying `{"allow": true|false}`. The admin identity is never sent, so a
broken endpoint cannot lock you out. Set the URL with
`VAULTS3_EXTERNAL_AUTH_URL` and the shared secret with
`VAULTS3_EXTERNAL_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Full guide, including the two modes and what this costs on the request path:
[Access control](ACCESS-CONTROL.md#external-authorization-webhook).

## Rate Limiting

Token bucket rate limiting is **on by default**, because an unauthenticated request is rate limited before it is authenticated, so the limiter is the only thing bounding what a flood costs the server:

```yaml
rate_limit:
  enabled: true
  requests_per_sec: 2000  # per client IP
  burst_size: 4000
  per_key_rps: 2000       # per access key
  per_key_burst: 4000
```

Each client IP and access key gets an independent token bucket. Requests exceeding the limit receive `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After: 1` header, which S3 SDKs retry automatically. Stale buckets are cleaned up after 5 minutes of inactivity.

The defaults sit far above what a real client sends: a saturating 8-thread `boto3` client measures around 1300 requests per second, well inside the ceiling, while a 64-thread flood is cut off. Set `enabled: false` to turn it off entirely.

**Behind a reverse proxy**, the per-IP bucket keys on the connection's real address rather than `X-Forwarded-For`, since a caller can forge that header. Every client arriving through nginx or a Kubernetes ingress therefore shares a single per-IP bucket. Raise `requests_per_sec` to cover your combined traffic in that setup, and rely on `per_key_rps` for per-tenant fairness.

```bash
# Check rate limiter status
curl http://localhost:9000/api/v1/ratelimit/status -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
